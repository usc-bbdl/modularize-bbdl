<h3>
Christoff Sulzenbacher <br /><br />
</h3>

<p>
I finished high school in 2012 and completed my community service in April, 2014. Before starting my undergrad in mechatronics at the Management Center Innsbruck, I had the opportunity to do a five month internship at the Brain-Body-Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Southern California. I specialized in CAD-simulations and 3D-printing, while also learning C and Python along the way.
