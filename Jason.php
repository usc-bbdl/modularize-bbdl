I received a Ph.D. in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics in 2008 from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.  I was mentored by Tony Bloch (Mathematics), Art Kuo (Mechanical & Biomedical Engineering), and Zev Rymer (Northwestern University Physiology and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago).  I developed experimental tools and computational analyses for understanding patterns of fluctuation in forces exerted by the human index finger, and related the observed force fluctuation patterns to muscle control strategies.  I found that for motor tasks in some directions, forces oscillate along a single direction, indicative of control by a single muscle, while in other motor tasks, forces oscillate in a variety of directions, indicative of control by multiple cooperating muscles. I did post-doctoral work with Francisco Valero-Cuevas at the University of Southern California, investigating the necessity of particular muscles and the biomechanical basis for muscle synergies.</p><p>I am currently a Research Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California. I am interested in neuromechanics, electrophysiology, computational hypothesis testing, and engineering of non-invasive systems, including ultrasound and MR imaging, to study human motor function.</p><a href="JasonFiles/JasonKutchCv.pdf"><strong>Curriculum Vitae including links to publication pdfs and presentation videos</strong></a><p></p><!-- Your part ends here! --><?php include("TemplateLower.php"); ?>
