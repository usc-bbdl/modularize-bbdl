While thevalidity of these tenets is routinely discussed and debated in theliterature, it is also necessary to present them to the community in amanner that challenges all of us to affirm, update or revise them. Thisis particularly true when challenges or revisions to these tenets hingeon the details of specialized computational approaches, a nuancedinterpretation of multiple experimental findings, a thorough knowledgeof a vast literature, integration of recent findings, and/or carefulsemantic distinctions. We have assembled a team of four investigatorswith relevant expertise to critically review four fundamental tenets inlight of recent work: <p>1) Muscle redundancy; Valero-Cuevas</p><p>2) Henneman's Size Principle; Kutch</p> <p>3) Spinal Circuitry for Motor Behavior; Loeb</p><p>4) Optimal Control; Theodorou</p> <p>The Panel will progress systematically from the periphery inwards to update and revise our understanding of these four critical aspect of SensorimotorNeuroscience. We begin by discussing how the physics of tendon-drivensystems defines the problem to be solved by the nervous system - and go onto show that we, in fact, have barely enough muscles for versatilebehavior. While these concepts do not change the fact that there existmultiple solutions for "simple" tasks (i.e., with few constraints) andin the close vicinity of a valid coordination pattern for a "complex"task (i.e., with multiple constraints), they do strongly set the scopeof feasible solutions, necessitate "co-contraction" and "synergistic"patterns independently of neural considerations - and make the systemvulnerable to loss or weakness of even single muscles.</p> <p> Next we transition to a reassessment of the physiological machinery that drives the recruitment of motor units - andchallenge the notion that recruitment system is as autonomous and robustas is generally believed. A noninvasive innovative approach calledEMG-weighted averaging can reveal the profile the motor unit activationpattern across the voluntary range (0-100% MVC) of an isometriccontraction. By linking this experimental approach with computationalmodels of motor unit activation we find that motor unit recruitment isitself tuned in accordance with their direction of mechanical forceoutput.<p><p>Third, a computational assessment of the most thoroughcompendium of spinal circuitry to date sheds light on the high-levelcentral drive necessary and sufficient to produce complex voluntarymovement - and suggest the system can robustly meet these demands in anygiven individual with minimal tuning of the parameters of the circuitry.</p><p>The final part discusses the limitations of the optimal control framework and itsimplications to neuromuscular systems. Optimal control requires accurateknowledge of the dynamics and cost functions. Even though theserequirements may be satisfied in tasks such as small reaching movements,they are strongly violated in learning scenarios or control tasks inwhich the dynamics and rewards are not known or vary (i.e., the majorityof motor behaviors). We will provide an overview of other controltheoretic and machine learning approaches - seldom applied in ourfield - motivated by these limitations and well suited to address them.These include reinforcement learning and model predictive, robust, andadaptive control.</p> <p><b><h3>Supplemental Material</h3></b></p><p><strong>2) Kutch: Rethinking motor unit activation in health and disease (Henneman's Size Principle)</strong></p><p><a href="MythsAndMonsters/Kutch_Slides.pdf"><strong>Presentation slides (in pdf)</strong></a></p><embed src="MythsAndMonsters/MuActivationAnimation.mov" width="512" height="384" loop="true" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"></embed>Quicktime plug-in must be installed to see animation.<p><a href="MythsAndMonsters/EwaExample.zip"><strong>MATLAB code for EMG-weightedaveraging, including instructions for use, example data, and accomanying publication.</strong></a></p><p></p><!-- Your part ends here! --><?php include("TemplateLower.php"); ?>
