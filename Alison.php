Alison Hu <br /><br />

<p>
I am a licensed physical therapist in Taiwan. As a PT, I care about the recovery/ physical performance of the patients; moreover, I'm very interested in scientific study of the medical treatment and in hopes of finding optimal solution to the current medical problem. I finished my bachelor degree in Physical Therapy along with a minor in Physics from National Taiwan University. The multi-disciplinary training not only broadens my horizon but also inspires my devotion to the research field regarding movement analysis, via which physical dysfunction is better understood and has better chance of being diminished.
Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD. in Biomedical Engineering at USC. I joined the lab in 2011. With other members of the lab, I am now studying hand dexterity of Parkinson disease patients. Through the innovative metrics developed by the lab, we hope to identify the critical parameter for early PD detection and retaining their maximal functional lives in the long run.
