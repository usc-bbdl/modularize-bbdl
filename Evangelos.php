During the last two years of his undergrad studies, he worked as machine vision engineer for European research projects on industrial vision. In 2003, he got his master's in industrial engineering from the Technical University of Crete. In his graduate studies back in Greece he was working as research assistant in the Dynamic Systems and Simulation Laboratory (<a class="centerlink" href="http://www.dssl.tuc.gr/">DSSL</a>). In his work in DSSL he designed, tested and evaluated stochastic optimal controllers applied to traffic urban networks. In 2004 he was accepted by the Computer Science and Engineering Department in the University of Minnesota USA. During his graduate studies in Minnesota he was research assistant in the Computational Perception and Action Lab (<a class="centerlink" href="http://gandalf.psych.umn.edu/groups/schraterlab/schraterlab.php">CPAB</a>). After getting his second master's from the University of Minnesota, he joined the Computer Science Dept at USC in spring 2007. He currently has a joint appointment with the Computational Learning and Motor Control Lab in Computer Sciene Dept and the Brain and Body Dynamics Lab (BBDL) in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy.</p><p>His research interest span over the areas of Optimal Control, Estimation and Reinforcement Learning with applications to Humanoid Robotics and Biomechanics.In particular, in the areas of Humanoid robotics his focus is on model free/model based Reinforcement learning algorithms applied to high dimensionsal,nonlinear robotic systems. In the area of biomechanics,  he is working towards developing Optimal Controllers for force/motion control with applications to grasping and hand control. By using control theory and estimation as conceptual tools his ultimate goal is to understand the underlying control principles of the human muskuloskeletal system and introduce new algorithms for hybrid optimal control applied to Humanoid Robotics.</p><?php include("TemplateLower.php"); ?>
