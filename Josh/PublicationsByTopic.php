<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/EvangelosACC11.pdf" TITLE = "Abstract: 
Our long-term goal is to find control principles to control robotic hands with dexterity and robustness comparable to that of the human hand. Here we explore a control strategy capable of accommodating the nonlinearities, high dimensionality and endogenous noise intrinsic to complex, tendon-driven biomechanical structures. We present the first stochastic optimal feedback controller (i.e., an iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller) applied to a tendon-driven simulated robotic index finger model. In our model we take into account both the tendon network driving of the index finger, and we consider first-order muscle dynamics. Our feedback controller shows robustness against noise and perturbation of the dynamics. Moreover, it can also successfully overcome the nonlinearities intrinsic to the mechanics of the finger for large postural changes, and the need for non-negative control signals. Our simulations provide, for the first time, the complete time history of tendon tensions, lengths and velocities for the tasks of tapping with nonzero terminal velocities required for dynamic manipulation.  We find that the optimal control of realistic tendon-driven systems fundamentally stretches current methods to their limits.  To find a successful control strategy, the algorithm must overcome several critical challenges inherent to the control of tendon-driven fingers systems in which all uni-directional control commands can actuate all joints (either directly or through dynamic coupling). Therefore, all elements of the solution are interwoven including the tuning of the cost function, the dynamics of the plant, and the initial guesses for state and control trajectories." target="_blank">Neuromuscular Stochastic Optimal Control of a Tendon Driven Index Finger Model </a>

It is well-known that muscle redundancy grants the CNS numerous options to perform a task. Does muscle redundancy, however, allow sufficient robustness to compensate for loss or dysfunction of even a single muscle? Are all muscles equally redundant? We combined experimental and computational approaches to establish the limits of motor robustness for static force production. In computer-controlled cadaveric index fingers, we find that only a small subset (<5%) of feasible forces is robust to loss of any one muscle. Importantly, the loss of certain muscles compromises force production significantly more than others. Further computational modeling of a multi-joint, multi-muscle leg demonstrates that this severe lack of robustness generalizes to whole limbs. These results provide a biomechanical basis to begin to explain why redundant motor systems can be vulnerable to even mild neuromuscular pathology." >Muscle redundancy does not imply robustness to muscle dysfunction</a>

Dexterous manipulation requires both strength, the ability to produce fingertip forces of a specific magnitude; and dexterity, the ability to dynamically regulate the magnitude and direction of fingertip force vectors and finger motions. While cortical activity in fronto-parietal networks has been established for stable grip and pinch forces, the cortical regulation in the dexterous control of unstable objects remains unknown. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to interrogate cortical networks engaged in the control of four objects with increasing instabilities but requiring constant strength. In addition to expected activity in fronto-parietal networks we find that dexterous manipulation of increasingly unstable objects is associated with a linear increase in the amplitude of the BOLD signal in the basal ganglia (p = 0.007 and p = 0.023 for two compression tasks). A computational regression (connectivity) model identified independent subsets of cortical networks whose connection strengths were mutable and associated with object instability (p< 0.001). Our results suggest that in the presence of object instability, the basal ganglia may modulate the activity of premotor areas and subsequent motor output. This work, therefore, provides new evidence for the selectable cortical representation and execution of dynamic multifinger manipulation for grasp stability.">Controlling instabilities in manipulation requires specific cortical-striatal-cerebellar networks.</a>

Hyperkinetic movements are unwanted or excess movements that are frequently seen in children with neurologic disorders. They are an important clinical finding with significant implications for diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of agreement on standard terminology and definitions interferes with clinical treatment and research. We describe definitions of dystonia, chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, tremor, tics, and stereotypies that arose from a consensus meeting in June 2008 of specialists from different clinical and basic science fields. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Chorea is an ongoing random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Athetosis is a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents maintenance of a stable posture. Myoclonus is a sequence of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. Tremor is a rhythmic back-and-forth or oscillating involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tics are repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. Stereotypies are repetitive, simple movements that can be voluntarily suppressed. We provide recommended techniques for clinical examination and suggestions for differentiating between the different types of hyperkinetic movements, noting that there may be overlap between conditions. These definitions and the diagnostic recommendations are intended to be reliable and useful for clinical practice, communication between clinicians and researchers, and for the design of quantitative tests that will guide and assess the outcome of future clinical trials.">Definition and Classification of Hyperkinetic Movements in Childhood.</a>

Aim:  Many everyday activities involve manipulation of objects with the fingertips. Impaired performance in manipulative tasks is common in neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus accurate assessment of an individual's ability to coordinate fingertip forces is important for planning treatment. We evaluated a recently developed assessment tool (the Strength-Dexterity Test), which is based on manipulation of unstable objects, in a paediatric population.
Method : A Rasch model was used to examine the validity and reliability of the Strength-Dexterity Test in a sample of 56 typically developing children and adolescents (30 males, 26 females; age range 4y 10mo, 17y 3mo; mean age 9y 8mo, SD 3y 8mo). In addition, we examined how performance on this test relates to widely used tests for assessment of gross manual dexterity (assessed with the Box and Blocks Test) and finger strength measured with a pinch meter.
Results: The constructs measured with the 78-item Strength-Dexterity Test include dexterity and strength, and form a unique unidimensional latent trait, named fingertip force coordination, that improves with age. The test has internal scale validity when applied to a typical paediatric population. Positive correlations (significant at p<0.001) were found among all three tests.
Interpretation : We provide preliminary evidence of construct validity in the Strength-Dexterity Test. Our findings suggest that this test has the potential to be developed into a promising tool for assessing dexterity in children.">Evidence of validity in a new method for measurement of dexterity in children and adolescents. </a> <br/>

We analyzed age-related changes in motor response in a visuomotor compensatory tracking task. Subjects used a manipulandum to attempt to keep a displayed cursor at the center of a screen despite random perturbations to its location. Cross-correlation analysis of the perturbation and the subject response showed no age-related increase in latency until the onset of response to the perturbation, but substantial slowing of the response itself. Results are consistent with age-related deterioration in the ratio of signal to noise in visuomotor response. The task is such that it is tractable to use Bayesian and quadratic optimality assumptions to construct a model for behavior. This model assumes that behavior resembles an optimal controller subject to noise, and parametrizes response in terms of latency, willingness to expend effort, noise intensity, and noise bandwidth. The model is consistent with the data for all young (n = 12, age 20-30) and most elderly (n = 12, age 65-92) subjects. The model reproduces the latency result from the cross-correlation method. When presented with increased noise, the computational model reproduces the experimentally observed age-related slowing and the observed lack of increased latency. The model provides a precise way to quantitatively formulate the long-standing hypothesis that age-related slowing is an adaptation to increased noise.">Slower visuomotor corrections with unchanged latency are an optimal adaptation to increased endogenous noise in the elderly.</a>

Moving our fingertips toward objects to produce well-directed forces immediately upon contact is fundamental to dexterous manipulation. This apparently simple mo- tion-to-force transition in fact involves a time-critical, predictive switch in control strategy. Given that dexterous manipulation must accommodate multiple mechanical conditions, we investigated whether and how this transition adapts to task difficulty. Eight adults (19-39 yr) produced ramps of isometric vertical fingertip force against a rigid surface immediately following a tapping motion. By changing target surface friction and size, we defined an easier (sand- paper, 11 mm diam) versus a more difficult (polished steel, 5 mm diam) task. As in prior work, we assembled fine-wire electromyograms from all seven muscles of the index finger into a seven- dimensional vector defining the full muscle coordination patterns and quantified its temporal evolution as its alignment with a reference coordination pattern vector for steady-state force production. As predicted by numerical optimizations to neuromuscular delays, our empirical and sigmoidal nonlinear regression analyses show that the coordination pattern transitions begin sooner for the more difficult tasks than for the easier tasks (~120 ms, P < 0.02, and ~115 ms, P < 0.015, respectively) and that the coordination pattern transition in alignment is well represented by a sigmoidal trend (R^2 < 0.7 in most cases). Importantly, the force vector following contact had smaller directional error (P < 0.02) for the more difficult task even though the transition in coordination pattern was less stereotypical and uniform than for the easier task. These adaptations of transition strategy to task difficulty are compatible with an optimization to counteract neuromuscular delays and noise to enable this fundamental element of dexterous manipulation.">The anticipatory control of motion-to-force transitions with the fingertips adapts optimally to task difficulty.</a>

Numerous studies of limbs and fingers propose that force and velocity properties of muscle limit maximal voluntary force production during anisometric tasks, i.e., when muscles are shortening or lengthening. Although this proposition appears logical, our study on the simul- taneous production of fingertip motion and force disagrees with this commonly held notion. We asked eight consenting adults to use their dominant index fingertip to maximize voluntary downward force against a horizontal surface at specific postures (static trials), and also during an anisometric scratching task of rhythmically moving the fingertip along a 5.8 ± 0.5 cm target line. The metronome-timed flexion-extension movement speed varied 36-fold from "slow" (1.0 ± 0.5 cm/s) to "fast" (35.9 ± 7.8 cm/s). As expected, maximal downward voluntary force diminished (44.8 ± 15.6%; p = 0.001) when any motion (slow or fast) was added to the task. Surprisingly, however, a 36-fold increase in speed did not affect this reduction in force magnitude. These remarkable results for such an ordinary task challenge the dominant role often attributed to force-velocity properties of muscle and provide insight into neuromechanical interac- tions. We propose an explanation that the simultaneous enforcement of mechanical constraints for motion and force reduces the set of feasible motor commands sufficiently so that force-velocity properties cease to be the force-limiting factor. While additional work is necessary to reveal the governing mechanisms, the dramatic influence that the simultaneous enforcement of motion and force con- straints has on force output begins to explain the vulnerability of dexterous function to development, aging, and even mild neuromus- cular pathology.">Maximal voluntary fingertip force production is not limited by movement speed in combined motion and force tasks.</a>

Numerous observations of struc- tured motor variability indicate that the sensorimotor system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters while allowing task-irrelevant ones to fluctuate. Optimality models show that controlling a redundant musculo-skeletal system in this manner meets task demands while min- imizing control effort. Although this line of inquiry has been very productive, the data are mostly behavioral with no direct physiological evidence on the level of muscle or neural activity. Furthermore, biome- chanical coupling, signal-dependent noise, and alternative causes of trial- to-trial variability confound behavioral studies. Here we address those confounds and present evidence that the nervous system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters on the muscle level. We asked subjects to produce vertical fingertip force vectors of prescribed constant or time-varying magnitudes while maintaining a constant finger posture. We recorded intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously from all seven index finger muscles during this task. The experiment design and selective fine-wire muscle recordings allowed us to account for a median of 91% of the variance of fingertip forces given the EMG signals. By analyzing muscle coordination in the seven-dimensional EMG signal space, we find that variance-per-dimension is consistently smaller in the task-relevant subspace than in the task-irrelevant subspace. This first direct physiological evidence on the muscle level for preferential control of task-relevant parameters strongly suggest the use of a neural control strategy compatible with the principle of minimal intervention. Addition- ally, variance is nonnegligible in all seven dimensions, which is at odds with the view that muscle activation patterns are composed from a small number of synergies.">Structured variability of muscle activations supports the

Researchers and clinicians routinely rely on interference electromyograms (EMGs) to estimate muscle forces and command signals in the neuromuscular system (e.g., amplitude, timing, and frequency content). The amplitude cancellation intrinsic to interference EMG, however, raises important questions about how to optimize these estimates. For example, what should the length of the epoch (time window) be to average an EMG signal to reliably estimate muscle forces and command signals? Shorter epochs are most practical, and significant reductions in epoch have been reported with high-pass filtering and whitening. Given that this processing attenuates power at frequencies of interest (< 250 Hz), however, it is unclear how it improves the extraction of physiologically-relevant information. We examined the influence of amplitude cancellation and high-pass filtering on the epoch necessary to accurately estimate the true average EMG amplitude calculated from a 28 s EMG trace (EMGref) during simulated constant isometric conditions. Monte Carlo iterations of a motor-unit model simulating 28 s of surface EMG produced 245 simulations under 2 conditions: with and without amplitude cancellation. For each simulation, we calculated the epoch necessary to generate average full-wave rectified EMG amplitudes that settled within 5% of EMGref. For the no-cancellation EMG, the necessary epochs were short (e.g., < 100 ms). For the more realistic interference EMG (i.e., cancellation condition), epochs shortened dramatically after using high-pass filter cutoffs above 250 Hz, producing epochs short enough to be practical (i.e., < 500 ms). We conclude that the need to use long epochs to accurately estimate EMG amplitude is likely the result of unavoidable amplitude cancellation, which helps to clarify why high-pass filtering > 250 Hz improves EMG estimates." > Epoch length to accurately estimate the amplitude of interference EMG is likely the result of unavoidable amplitude cancellation.</a>

We present a numerical exploration of contact transitions with the fingertip. When picking up objects our fingertips must make contact at specific locations, and upon contact maintain posture while producing well directed force vectors. However, the joint torques for moving the fingertip towards a surface (tm) are different from those for producing static force vectors (tf). We previously described the neural control of such abrupt transitions in humans, and found that unavoidable errors arise because sensorimotor time delays and lags prevent an instantaneous switch between different torques. Here, we use numerical optimization on a finger model to reveal physical bounds for controlling such rapid contact transitions. Resembling human data, it is necessary to anticipatorily switch joint torques to tf at about 30 ms before contact to minimize the initial misdirection of the fingertip force vector. This anticipatory strategy arises in our deterministic model from neuromuscular lags, and not from optimizing for robustness to noise/uncertainties. Importantly, the optimal solution also leads to a tradeoff between the speed of force magnitude increase versus the accuracy of initial force direction. This is an alternative to prevailing theories that propose multiplicative noise in muscles as the driver of speed-accuracy tradeoffs. We instead find that the speed-accuracy tradeoff arises solely from neuromuscular lags. Finally, because our model intentionally uses idealized assumptions, its agreement with human data suggests that the biological system is controlled in a way that approaches the physical boundaries of performance.

The neural control of tasks such as rapid acquisition of precision pinch remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the neural control of finger musculature when the index fingertip abruptly transitions from motion to static force production. Nine subjects produced a downward tapping motion followed by vertical fingertip force against a rigid surface. We simultaneously recorded three-dimensional fingertip force, plus the complete muscle coordination pattern using intramuscular electromyograms from all seven index finger muscles. We found that the muscle coordination pattern clearly switched from that for motion to that for isometric force ~65 ms before contact ( p 
< 0.0004). Mathematical modeling and analysis revealed that the underlying neural control also switched between mutually incompatible strategies in a time-critical manner. Importantly, this abrupt switch in underlying neural control polluted fingertip force vector direction beyond what is explained by muscle activation-contraction dynamics and neuromuscular noise ( p < 0.003). We further ruled out an impedance control strategy in a separate test showing no systematic change in initial force magnitude for catch trials where the tapping surface was surreptitiously lowered and raised ( p < 0.93). We conclude that the nervous system predictively switches between mutually incompatible neural control strategies to bridge the abrupt transition in mechanical constraints between motion and static force. Moreover because the nervous system cannot switch between control strategies instantaneously or exactly, there arise physical limits to the accuracy of force production on contact. The need for such a neurally demanding and time-critical strategy for routine motion-to-force transitions with the fingertip may explain the existence of specialized neural circuits for the human hand.

Studies of the degrees of freedom and synergies in musculoskeletal systems rely critically on algorithms to estimate the "dimension" of kinematic or neural data. Linear algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) are the most popular. However, many biological data (or realistic experimental data) may be better represented by nonlinear sets than linear subspaces. We evaluate the performance of PCA and compare it to two nonlinear algorithms [Isomap and our novel pointwise dimension estimation (PD-E)] using synthetic and motion capture data from a robotic arm with known kinematic dimensions, as well as motion capture data from human hands. We find that PCA can lead to more accurate dimension estimates when considering additional properties of the PCA residuals, instead of the dominant method of using a threshold of variance captured. In contrast to the single integer dimension estimates of PCA and Isomap, PD-E provides a distribution and range of estimates of fractal dimension that identify the heterogeneous geometric structure in the experimental data. A strength of the PD-E method is that it associates a distribution of dimensions to the data. Since there is no a priori reason to assume that the sets of interest have a single dimension, these distributions incorporate more information than a single summary statistic. Our preliminary findings suggest that fewer than ten DOFs are involved in some hand motion tasks. Contrary to common opinion regarding fractal dimension methods, PD-E yielded reasonable results with reasonable amounts of data. Given the complex nature of experimental and biological data, we conclude that it is necessary and feasible to complement PCA with methods that take into consideration the nonlinear properties of biological systems for a more robust estimation of their DOFs."> Estimating effective degrees of freedom in motor systems.</a>

Computational models of motor-unit populations are the objective implementations of the hypothesized mechanisms by which neural and muscle properties give rise to electromyograms (EMGs) and force. However, the variability/uncertainty of the parameters used in these models  and how they affect predictions confounds assessing these hypothesized mechanisms.

To exhaustively explore model performance and robustness, we ran numerous iterative simulations each using a random set of values for nine commonly measured motor neuron and muscle parameters. Parameter values were sampled across their reported experimental ranges. Convergence after 439 simulations found that only 3 simulations met our two fitness criteria: approximating the well-established experimental relations for the scaling of EMG amplitude and force variability with mean force. An additional 424 simulations preferen- tially sampling the neighborhood of those 3 valid simulations converged to reveal 65 additional sets of parameter values for which the model predictions approximate the experimentally known relations. We find the model is not sensitive to muscle properties but very sensitive to several motor neuron properties, especially peak dis- charge rates and recruitment ranges. Therefore to advance our under- standing of EMG and muscle force, it is critical to evaluate the hypothesized neural mechanisms as implemented in today's state-of- the-art models of motor unit function. We discuss experimental and analytical avenues to do so as well as new features that may be added in future implementations of motor-unit models to improve their experimental validity."> Experimentally-valid predictions of muscle force and EMG in models of motor unit function are most sensitive to neural properties.</a>

Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the propor- tion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal inter- phalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information pro- cessing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural â€œsomatic logic, found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks."> The tendon network of the fingers performs anatomical computation at a macroscopic scale.</a>

Models of motor guidance that dynamically adjust to the availability and quality of sensory information are based on the observation that dexterous tasks are routinely performed using various combinations of visual and tactile inputs. However, a dynamic neural system that acquires and processes relevant visual and tactile information remains relatively uncharacterized in humans. In this study, whole-brain functional magnetic resonance images were acquired during a dexterous manipulation task, compression of the end caps of a slender spring prone to buckling, to investigate the neural systems associated with motor guidance under four visual and tactile guidance conditions: (1) eyes closed (no visual input), smooth end caps, (2) eyes closed, rough end caps, (3) eyes open and watching hand, smooth end caps, and (4) eyes open and watching hand, rough end caps. Performance of the dexterous task remained constant in all conditions. Variations in the two levels of visual input resulted in modulation of activity in the precentral (primary motor) gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum activities were not modulated by levels of either visual or somatosensory input, and no interaction effects were observed. Together, these data indicate that a fine-tuned motor task guided by varying visual and tactile information engages a distributed and integrated neural complex consisting of control and executive functions and regions that process dynamic sensory information related to guidance functions."> Visual and Tactile Guidance of Dexterous Manipulation Tasks: an fMRI Study.</a>

The exquisite mechanical functionality and versatility of the human hand emerges from complex neuro-musculo-skeletal interactions that are not completely understood. I have found it useful to work within a theoretical/experimental paradigm that outlines the fundamental neuro-musculo-skeletal components and their interactions. In this integrative paradigm, the laws of mechanics, the specifications of the manipulation task, and the sensorimotor signals define the interactions among hand anatomy, the nervous system, and manipulation function. Thus, our collaborative research activities emphasize a firm grounding in the mechanics of finger function, insistence on anatomical detail, and meticulous characterization of muscle activity. This overview of our work on precision pinch (i.e., the ability to produce and control fingertip forces) presents some of our findings around three Research Themes: Mechanics-based quantification of manipulation ability; Anatomically realistic musculoskeletal finger models; and Neural control of finger muscles. I conclude that (i) driving the fingers to some limit of sensorimotor performance is instrumental to elucidating motor control strategies; (ii) that the cross-over of tendons from flexors to extensors in the extensor mechanism is needed to produce force in every direction, and (iii) the anatomical routing of multiarticular muscles makes co- contraction unavoidable for many tasks. Moreover, creating realistic and clinically useful finger models still requires developing new computational means to simulate the viscoelastic tendinous networks of the extensor mechanism, and the muscle-bone-ligament interactions in complex articulations. Building upon this neuromuscular biomechanics paradigm is of immense clinical relevance: it will be instrumental to the development of clinical treatments to preserve and restore manual ability in people suffering from neurological and orthopedic conditions. This understanding will also advance the design and control of robotic hands whose performance lags far behind that of their biological counterparts."> An integrative approach to the biomechanical function and neuromuscular control of the fingers.</a>

We present the development of a vision-feedback method to characterize how selective paralysis distorts the three-dimensional (3D) volume representing digit-tip force production capability and its application to healthy individuals producing thumb-tip force with and without simulated low ulnar nerve palsy (LUNP). Subjects produced maximal static voluntary force spanning the transverse, sagittal and frontal planes of the thumb (16, 15 and 10 subjects, respectively). Subjects produced thumb-tip force tasks in guided and self-selected directions. The envelope (convex hull) of extreme forces in each plane approximated that cross-section of the 3D volume of force capability.  Some subjects repeated the tasks with a temporary ulnar nerve block applied at the wrist to simulate complete acute LUNP. Three geometric properties of the force convex hull characterized each cross-section's shape: the ratios of its principal moments of inertia (RPMIs), the orientation of its principal axis (OPA), and its centroid location. Our results show that force production in the thumb's sagittal plane may be a reproducible and objective test to grade motor impairment in LUNP: paired t-tests of the larger RPMI in this plane best distinguished the nerve-blocked cases from the control cases in the guided task (p = 0.012), and Discriminant Analysis of the centroid location for the self-selected task in this plane correctly classified 94.7% of subjects into the control and ulnar nerve-blocked groups. We show that our method measures and detects changes in a digit's force production capabilities. Towards a clinical test of motor impairment in LUNP, this biomechanical study dictates which 3D thumb-tip forces to measure (those in the sagittal plane) and how to measure them (using the self-selected task)."> Quantifying deficits in the 3D force capabilities of a digit caused by selective paralysis: application to the thumb with simulated low ulnar nerve palsy.</a>

We have developed a method to quantify the dynamic interaction between fingertip force magnitude (strength) and directional control (dexterity) during pinch with a novel strength-dexterity (S-D) test based on the principle of buckling of compression springs. The test consists of asking participants to use key and opposition pinch to attempt to fully compress springs, in random order, with a wide range of combinations of strength and dexterity requirements. The minimum force required to fully compress the spring and the propensity of the spring to buckle define the strength and dexterity requirements, respectively. The S-D score for each pinch style was the sum of the strength values of all springs successfully compressed fully. We tested 3 participant groups: 18 unimpaired young adults (p40 yr), 10 unimpaired older adults <=40 yr), and 14 adults diagnosed with carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA) >= yr). We investigated the repeatability of the S-D test with 74 springs by testing 14 young adults twice on different days. The per-spring repeatability across subjects was >=94%. A minimum performance score for young adults was found as they all could compress a subset of 39 springs. Using this subset of springs, we compared the ability of the S-D score vs. maximal pinch force values to distinguish unimpaired hands from those with CMC OA of the thumb. The score for this 39-spring S-D test distinguished between CMC OA and asymptomatic older adults, whereas pinch meter readings did not (p<0:05). We conclude that the S-D test is repeatable and applicable to clinical research. We propose including the S-D test in studies aiming to quantify impairment and compare treatment outcomes in orthopaedic and neurological afflictions that degrade dynamic manipulation."> The strength-dexterity test as a measure of dynamic pinch performance. </a>

The ability to direct forces between the thumb and fingers is important to secure objects in the hand. We compared the coordination of thumb musculature in key and opposition pinch postures between stable and unstable tasks. The unstable task (producing thumb-tip force wearing a beaded thimble) required well-directed forces; the stable task (producing thumb-tip force against a pinch meter) did not. Fine-wire electromyography of thumb muscles and thumb-tip force magnitudes were recorded. We found no statistical differences in thumb-tip force between postures or stable versus unstable tasks, indicating that the highest magnitudes of force can be accurately directed. Abductor pollicis brevis and extensor pollicis longus were significantly more activated in the unstable tasks, suggesting their importance in directing thumb-tip force. Understanding how pinch forces are directed might influence the choice of muscle-tendon transfers performed to restore function to the severely paralyzed thumb.

Objective estimates of fingertip force reduction following peripheral nerve injuries would assist clinicians in setting realistic expectations for rehabilitating strength of grasp. We quantifed the reduction in fngertip force that can be biomechanically attributed to paralysis of the groups of muscles associated with low radial and ulnar palsies. We mounted 11 fresh cadaveric hands (5 right, 6 left) on a frame, placed their forefngers in a functional posture (neutral abduction, 453 of flexion at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and 103 at the distal interphalangeal joint) and pinned the distal phalanx to a six-axis dynamometer. We pulled on individual tendons with tensions up to 25% of maximal isometric force of their associated muscle and measured fngertip force and torque output. Based on these measurements, we predicted the optimal combination of tendon tensions that maximized palmar force (analogous to tip pinch force, directed perpendicularly from the midpoint of the distal phalanx, in the plane of fnger flexion}extension) for three cases: non-paretic (all muscles of forefnger available), low radial palsy (extrinsic extensor muscles unavailable) and low ulnar palsy (intrinsic muscles unavailable). We then applied these combinations of tension to the cadaveric tendons and measured fngertip output. Measured palmar forces were within 2% and 53 of the predicted magnitude and direction, respectively, suggesting tendon tensions superimpose linearly in spite of the complexity of the extensor mechanism. Maximal palmar forces for ulnar and radial palsies were 43 and 85% of non-paretic magnitude, respectively (p<0.05). Thus, the reduction in tip pinch strength seen clinically in low radial palsy may be partly due to loss of the biomechanical contribution of forefnger extrinsic extensor muscles to palmar force. Fingertip forces in low ulnar palsy were 93 further from the desired palmar direction than the non-paretic or low radial palsy cases (p<0.05)."> Quantification of fingertip force reduction in the forefinger following simulated paralysis of extensor and intrinsic muscles. </a>

Human fingers have sufficiently more muscles than joints such that every fingertip force of submaximal magnitude can be produced by an infinite number of muscle coordination patterns. Nevertheless, the nervous system seems to effortlessly select muscle coordination patterns when sequentially producing fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the selection of coordination patterns to produce submaximal forces is simplified by the appropriate modulation of the magnitude of a muscle coordination pattern capable of producing the largest expected fingertip force. In each of three directions, eight subjects were asked to sequentially produce fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude with their dominant forefinger. Muscle activity was described by fine-wire electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously collected from all muscles of the forefinger. A muscle coordination pattern was defined as the vector list of the EMG activity of each muscle. For all force directions, statistically significant muscle coordination patterns simi- lar to those previously reported for 100% of maximal fingertip forces were found for 50% of maximal voluntary force. Furthermore the coordination pattern and fingertip force vector magnitudes were highly correlated (r > 0.88). Average coordination pattern vectors at 50 and 100% of maximal force were highly correlated with each other, as well as with individual coordination pattern vectors in the ramp transitions preceding them. In contrast to this consistency of EMG coordination patterns, predictions using a musculoskeletal computer model of the forefinger show that force magnitudes <=50% of maximal fingertip force can be produced by coordination patterns drastically different from those needed for maximal force. Thus when modulating fingertip force magnitude across the voluntary range, the number of contributing muscles and the relative activity among them was not changed. Rather, the production of low and moderate forces seems to be simplified by appropriately scaling the magnitude of a coordination pattern capable of producing the highest force expected."> Predictive modulation of muscle coordination pattern magnitude scales fingertip force magnitude over the voluntary range.</a>

Are fingertip forces produced by subject-independent patterns of muscle excitation? If so, understanding themechanical basis underlying these muscle coordination strategies would greatly assist surgeons in evaluating options for restoring grasping. With the finger in neutral ad- abduction and flexed 45° at the MCP and PIP, and 10° at DIP joints, eight subjects attempted to produce maximal voluntary forces in four orthogonal directions perpendicular to the distal phalanx (palmar, dorsal, lateral and medial) and in one direction collinear with it (distal). Forces were directed within 4.7±2.2° (mean ± S.D.) of target and their magnitudes clustered into three distinct levels (p<0.05; post hoc pairwise RMANOVA). Palmar (27.9±4.1N), distal (24.3±8.3N) and medial (22.9±7.8 N) forces were highest, lateral (14.7±4.8 N) was intermediate, and dorsal (7.5±1.5 N) was lowest. Normalized fine-wire EMGs from all seven muscles revealed distinct muscle excitation groups for palmar, dorsal and distal forces (p<0.05; post hoc pairwise RMANOVA). Palmar force used flexors, extensors and dorsal interosseous; dorsal force used all muscles; distal force used all muscles except for extensors; medial and lateral forces used all muscles including significant co-excitation of interossei. The excitation strategies predicted to achieve maximal force by a 3-D computer model (four pin joints, inextensible tendons, extensor mechanism and isometric force models for all seven muscles) reproduced the observed use of extensors and absence of palmar interosseous to produce palmar force (to regulate net joint flexion torques), the absence of extensors for distal force, and the use of intrinsics (strong MCP flexors) for dorsal force. The model could not predict the interossei co-excitation seen for medial and lateral forces, which may be a strategy to prevent MCP joint damage. The model predicts distal force to be most sensitive to dorsal interosseous strength, and palmar and distal forces to be very sensitive to MCP and PIP flexor moment arms, and dorsal force to be sensitive to the moment arm of and the tension allocation to the PIP extensor tendon of the extensor mechanism."> Large index-fingertip forces are produced by subject-independent patterns of muscle excitation.</a>

When accurately placed, fine-wire electrodes (FWEs) permit selective electromyographic recording during kinesiologic studies; however, their potential to limit contraction of the index finger muscles has not previously been evaluated. Given that these electrodes cannot be reinserted, reliable techniques are necessary to achieve proper placement while minimizing subject discomfort and electrode waste. The small size, close arrangement, and anatomic variability of hand and forearm muscles create challenges to achieving these goals. In this study, we simultaneously measured maximal fingertip forces and fine-wire electromyographic signals from all seven muscles of the index finger. Forces in five directions, with and without FWEs in place, were not statistically different (repeated-measures analysis of variance, P< 0.46) in five healthy adult subjects. To guide electrode placement, we identified skin penetration landmarks, direction of needle advancement, and depth of muscle fibers. Fibers of flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger were more distal than depicted in textbooks, requiring electrode placementat or distal to the midpoint of the forearm. For these muscles and the extensor digitorum, locating the desired fibers first with a monopolar needle electrode facilitated subsequent FWF placement. For the dorsal and palmar interossei, lumbrical, and extensor indicis proprius, insertion was aided by concurrent monitoring of the electromyographic signals. We achieved a 93% success rate during FWE placement in a total of 60 muscles.

Dexterous manipulation requires both â€œstrengthâ€, the ability to produce fingertip forces of a specific magnitude; and â€œdexterityâ€, the ability to dynamically regulate the magnitude and direction of fingertip force vectors and finger motions. While cortical activity in fronto-parietal networks has been established for stable grip and pinch forces, the cortical regulation in the dexterous control of unstable objects remains unknown. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to interrogate cortical networks engaged in the control of four objects with increasing instabilities but requiring constant strength. In addition to expected activity in fronto-parietal networks we find thatCortical-striatal-cerebellar networks for manipulation.

A computational regression (connectivity) model identified independent subsets of cortical networks whose connection strengths were mutable and associated with object instability (p< 0.001). Our results suggest that in the presence of object instability, the basal ganglia may modulate the activity of premotor areas and subsequent motor output.

We analyzed age-related changes in motor response in a visuomotor compensatory tracking task. Subjects used a manipulandum to attempt to keep a displayed cursor at the center of a screen despite random perturbations to its location. Cross-correlation analysis of the perturbation and the subject response showed no age-related increase in latency until the onset of response to the perturbation, but substantial slowing of the response itself. Results are consistent with age-related deterioration in the ratio of signal to noise in visuomotor response. The task is such that it is tractable to use Bayesian and quadratic optimality assumptions to construct a model for behavior. This model assumes that behavior resembles an optimal controller subject to noise, and parametrizes response in terms of latency, willingness to expend effort, noise intensity, and noise bandwidth. The model is consistent with the data for all young (n = 12, age 20â€“30) and most elderly (n = 12, age 65â€“92) subjects. The model reproduces the latency result from the cross-correlation method. When presented with increased noise, the computational model reproduces the experimentally observed age-related slowing and the observed lack of increased latency. The model provides a precise way to quantitatively formulate the long-standing hypothesis that age-related slowing is an adaptation to increased noise.">Slower visuomotor corrections with unchanged latency are an optimal adaptation to increased endogenous noise in the elderly.</a>

First published November 4, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00233.2009. Moving our fingertips toward objects to produce well-directed forces immediately upon contact is fundamental to dexterous manipulation. This apparently simple mo- tion-to-force transition in fact involves a time-critical, predictive switch in control strategy. Given that dexterous manipulation must accommodate multiple mechanical conditions, we investigated whether and how this transition adapts to task difficulty. Eight adults (19â€“39 yr) produced ramps of isometric vertical fingertip force against a rigid surface immediately following a tapping motion. By changing target surface friction and size, we defined an easier (sand- paper, 11 mm diam) versus a more difficult (polished steel, 5 mm diam) task. As in prior work, we assembled fine-wire electromyograms from all seven muscles of the index finger into a seven- dimensional vector defining the full muscle coordination patternâ€”and quantified its temporal evolution as its alignment with a reference coordination pattern vector for steady-state force production. As predicted by numerical optimizations to neuromuscular delays, our empirical and sigmoidal nonlinear regression analyses show that the coordination pattern transitions begin sooner for the more difficult tasks than for the easier tasks (ô°ƒ120 ms, P ô°„ 0.02, and ô°ƒ115 ms, P ô°„ 0.015, respectively) and that the coordination pattern transition in alignment is well represented by a sigmoidal trend (R^2 ô°… 0.7 in most cases). Importantly, the force vector following contact had smaller directional error (P ô°„ 0.02) for the more difficult task even though the transition in coordination pattern was less stereotypical and uniform than for the easier task. These adaptations of transition strategy to task difficulty are compatible with an optimization to counteract neuro- muscular delays and noise to enable this fundamental element of dexterous manipulation.">The anticipatory control of motion-to-force transitions with the fingertips adapts optimally to task difficulty.</a>

Numerous studies of limbs and fingers propose that forceâ€“velocity properties of muscle limit maximal voluntary force production during anisometric tasks, i.e., when muscles are shortening or lengthening. Although this proposition appears logical, our study on the simul- taneous production of fingertip motion and force disagrees with this commonly held notion. We asked eight consenting adults to use their dominant index fingertip to maximize voluntary downward force against a horizontal surface at specific postures (static trials), and also during an anisometric â€œscratchingâ€ task of rhythmically moving the fingertip along a 5.8 ô°‹ 0.5 cm target line. The metronome-timed flexionâ€“ extension movement speed varied 36-fold from â€œslowâ€ (1.0 ô°‹ 0.5 cm/s) to â€œfastâ€ (35.9 ô°‹ 7.8 cm/s). As expected, maximal downward voluntary force diminished (44.8 ô°‹ 15.6%; p ô°ˆ 0.001) when any motion (slow or fast) was added to the task. Surprisingly, however, a 36-fold increase in speed did not affect this reduction in force magnitude. These remarkable results for such an ordinary task challenge the dominant role often attributed to forceâ€“velocity properties of muscle and provide insight into neuromechanical interac- tions. We propose an explanation that the simultaneous enforcement of mechanical constraints for motion and force reduces the set of feasible motor commands sufficiently so that forceâ€“velocity properties cease to be the force-limiting factor. While additional work is necessary to reveal the governing mechanisms, the dramatic influence that the simultaneous enforcement of motion and force con- straints has on force output begins to explain the vulnerability of dexterous function to development, aging, and even mild neuromus- cular pathology.">Maximal voluntary fingertip force production is not limited by movement speed in combined motion and force tasks.</a>

First published April 15, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.90324.2008. Numerous observations of struc- tured motor variability indicate that the sensorimotor system preferen- tially controls task-relevant parameters while allowing task-irrelevant ones to fluctuate. Optimality models show that controlling a redundant musculo-skeletal system in this manner meets task demands while min- imizing control effort. Although this line of inquiry has been very productive, the data are mostly behavioral with no direct physiological evidence on the level of muscle or neural activity. Furthermore, biome- chanical coupling, signal-dependent noise, and alternative causes of trial- to-trial variability confound behavioral studies. Here we address those confounds and present evidence that the nervous system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters on the muscle level. We asked subjects to produce vertical fingertip force vectors of prescribed constant or time-varying magnitudes while maintaining a constant finger posture. We recorded intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously from all seven index finger muscles during this task. The experiment design and selective fine-wire muscle recordings allowed us to account for a median of 91% of the variance of fingertip forces given the EMG signals. By analyzing muscle coordination in the seven-dimensional EMG signal space, we find that variance-per-dimension is consistently smaller in the task-relevant subspace than in the task-irrelevant subspace. This first direct physiological evidence on the muscle level for preferential control of task-relevant parameters strongly suggest the use of a neural control strategy compatible with the principle of minimal intervention. Addition- ally, variance is nonnegligible in all seven dimensions, which is at odds with the view that muscle activation patterns are composed from a small number of synergies.">Structured variability of muscle activations supports the

Researchers and clinicians routinely rely on interference electromyograms (EMGs) to estimate muscle forces and command signals in the neuromuscular system (e.g., amplitude, timing, and frequency content). The amplitude cancellation intrinsic to interference EMG, however, raises important questions about how to optimize these estimates. For example, what should the length of the epoch (time window) be to average an EMG signal to reliably estimate muscle forces and command signals? Shorter epochs are most practical, and significant reductions in epoch have been reported with high-pass filtering and whitening. Given that this processing attenuates power at frequencies of interest (< 250 Hz), however, it is unclear how it improves the extraction of physiologically-relevant information. We examined the influence of amplitude cancellation and high-pass filtering on the epoch necessary to accurately estimate the â€œtrueâ€ average EMG amplitude calculated from a 28 s EMG trace (EMGref) during simulated constant isometric conditions. Monte Carlo iterations of a motor-unit model simulating 28 s of surface EMG produced 245 simulations under 2 conditions: with and without amplitude cancellation. For each simulation, we calculated the epoch necessary to generate average full-wave rectified EMG amplitudes that settled within 5% of EMGref. For the no-cancellation EMG, the necessary epochs were short (e.g., < 100 ms). For the more realistic interference EMG (i.e., cancellation condition), epochs shortened dramatically after using high-pass filter cutoffs above 250 Hz, producing epochs short enough to be practical (i.e., < 500 ms). We conclude that the need to use long epochs to accurately estimate EMG amplitude is likely the result of unavoidable amplitude cancellation, which helps to clarify why high-pass filtering (> 250 Hz) improves EMG estimates."> Epoch length to accurately estimate the amplitude of interference EMG is likely the result of unavoidable amplitude cancellation.</a>

We present a numerical exploration of contact transitions with the fingertip. When picking up objects our fingertips must make contact at specific locations, andâ€”upon contactâ€”maintain posture while producing well-directed force vectors. However, the joint torques for moving the fingertip towards a surface (tm) are different from those for producing static force vectors (tf). We previously described the neural control of such abrupt transitions in humans, and found that unavoidable errors arise because sensorimotor time delays and lags prevent an instantaneous switch between different torques. Here, we use numerical optimization on a finger model to reveal physical bounds for controlling such rapid contact transitions. Resembling human data, it is necessary to anticipatorily switch joint torques to tf at about 30 ms before contact to minimize the initial misdirection of the fingertip force vector. This anticipatory strategy arises in our deterministic model from neuromuscular lags, and not from optimizing for robustness to noise/uncertainties. Importantly, the optimal solution also leads to a trade-off between the speed of force magnitude increase versus the accuracy of initial force direction. This is an alternative to prevailing theories that propose multiplicative noise in muscles as the driver of speedâ€“accuracy trade-offs. We instead find that the speedâ€“accuracy trade-off arises solely from neuromuscular lags. Finally, because our model intentionally uses idealized assumptions, its agreement with human data suggests that the biological system is controlled in a way that approaches the physical boundaries of performance.

Abstractâ€”Studies of the degrees of freedom and â€œsynergiesâ€ in musculoskeletal systems rely critically on algorithms to estimate the â€œdimensionâ€ of kinematic or neural data. Linear algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) are the most popular. However, many biological data (or realistic experimental data) may be better represented by nonlinear sets than linear subspaces. We evaluate the performance of PCA and compare it to two nonlinear algorithms [Isomap and our novel pointwise dimension estimation (PD-E)] using synthetic and motion capture data from a robotic arm with known kinematic dimensions, as well as motion capture data from human hands. We find that PCA can lead to more accurate dimension estimates when considering additional properties of the PCA residuals, instead of the dominant method of using a threshold of variance captured. In contrast to the single integer dimension estimates of PCA and Isomap, PD-E provides a distribution and range of estimates of fractal dimension that identify the heterogeneous geometric structure in the experimental data. A strength of the PD-E method is that it associates a distribution of dimensions to the data. Since there is no a priori reason to assume that the sets of interest have a single dimension, these distributions incorporate more information than a single summary statistic. Our preliminary findings suggest that fewer than ten DOFs are involved in some hand motion tasks. Contrary to common opinion regarding fractal dimension methods, PD-E yielded reasonable results with reasonable amounts of data. Given the complex nature of experimental and biological data, we conclude that it is necessary and feasible to complement PCA with methods that take into consideration the nonlinear properties of biological systems for a more robust estimation of their DOFs.

Keenan KG, Valero-Cuevas FJ. Experimentally valid predictions of muscle force and EMG in models of motor-unit function are most sensitive to neural properties. J Neurophysiol 98: 1581â€“1590, 2007. First published July 5, 2007; doi:10.1152/jn.00577.2007. Computa- tional models of motor-unit populations are the objective implemen- tations of the hypothesized mechanisms by which neural and muscle properties give rise to electromyograms (EMGs) and force. However, the variability/uncertainty of the parameters used in these modelsâ€” and how they affect predictionsâ€”confounds assessing these hypoth- esized mechanisms. We perform a large-scale computational sensitiv- ity analysis on the state-of-the-art computational model of surface EMG, force, and force variability by combining a comprehensive review of published experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations. To exhaustively explore model performance and robustness, we ran numerous iterative simulations each using a random set of values for nine commonly measured motor neuron and muscle parameters. Parameter values were sampled across their reported experimental ranges. Convergence after 439 simulations found that only 3 simula- tions met our two fitness criteria: approximating the well-established experimental relations for the scaling of EMG amplitude and force variability with mean force. An additional 424 simulations preferen- tially sampling the neighborhood of those 3 valid simulations con- verged to reveal 65 additional sets of parameter values for which the model predictions approximate the experimentally known relations. We find the model is not sensitive to muscle properties but very sensitive to several motor neuron propertiesâ€”especially peak dis- charge rates and recruitment ranges. Therefore to advance our under- standing of EMG and muscle force, it is critical to evaluate the hypothesized neural mechanisms as implemented in todayâ€™s state-of- the-art models of motor unit function. We discuss experimental and analytical avenues to do so as well as new features that may be added in future implementations of motor-unit models to improve their experimental validity."> Experimentally-valid predictions of muscle force and EMG in models of motor unit function are most sensitive to neural properties.</a>

Abstractâ€”Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the propor- tion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal inter- phalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information pro- cessing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural â€œsomatic logicâ€ found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks."> The tendon network of the fingers performs anatomical computation at a macroscopic scale.</a>

The exquisite mechanical functionality and versatility of the human hand emerges from complex neuroâ€“musculoâ€“skeletal interactions that are not completely understood. I have found it useful to work within a theoretical/experimental paradigm that outlines the fundamental neuroâ€“musculoâ€“skeletal components and their interactions. In this integrative paradigm, the laws of mechanics, the specifications of the manipulation task, and the sensorimotor signals define the interactions among hand anatomy, the nervous system, and manipulation function. Thus, our collaborative research activities emphasize a firm grounding in the mechanics of finger function, insistence on anatomical detail, and meticulous characterization of muscle activity. This overview of our work on precision pinch (i.e., the ability to produce and control fingertip forces) presents some of our findings around three Research Themes: Mechanics-based quantification of manipulation ability; Anatomically realistic musculoskeletal finger models; and Neural control of finger muscles. I conclude that (i) driving the fingers to some limit of sensorimotor performance is instrumental to elucidating motor control strategies; (ii) that the cross-over of tendons from flexors to extensors in the extensor mechanism is needed to produce force in every direction, and (iii) the anatomical routing of multiarticular muscles makes co- contraction unavoidable for many tasks. Moreover, creating realistic and clinically useful finger models still requires developing new computational means to simulate the viscoelastic tendinous networks of the extensor mechanism, and the muscleâ€“boneâ€“ligament interactions in complex articulations. Building upon this neuromuscular biomechanics paradigm is of immense clinical relevance: it will be instrumental to the development of clinical treatments to preserve and restore manual ability in people suffering from neurological and orthopedic conditions. This understanding will also advance the design and control of robotic hands whose performance lags far behind that of their biological counterparts.

We present the development of a vision-feedback method to characterize how selective paralysis distorts the three-dimensional (3D) volume representing digit-tip force production capability and its application to healthy individuals producing thumb-tip force with and without simulated low ulnar nerve palsy (LUNP). Subjects produced maximal static voluntary force spanning the transverse, sagittal and frontal planes of the thumb (16, 15 and 10 subjects, respectively). Subjects produced thumb-tip force tasks in guided and self-selected directions. The envelope (convex hull) of extreme forces in each plane approximated that cross-section of the3Dvolumeofforcecapability.Somesubjectsrepeatedthetaskswithatemporaryulnarnerveblockappliedatthewristto simulate complete acute LUNP. Three geometric properties of the force convex hull characterized each cross-sectionâ€™s shape: the ratios of its principal moments of inertia (RPMIs), the orientation of its principal axis (OPA), and its centroid location. Our results show that force production in the thumbâ€™s sagittal plane may be a reproducible and objective test to grade motor impairment in LUNP: paired t-tests of the larger RPMI in this plane best distinguished the nerve-blocked cases from the control cases in the guided task (p 1â„4 0:012), and Discriminant Analysis of the centroid location for the self-selected task in this plane correctly classified 94.7% of subjects into the control and ulnar nerve-blocked groups. We show that our method measures and detects changes in a digitâ€™s force production capabilities. Towards a clinical test of motor impairment in LUNP, this biomechanical study dictates which 3D thumb-tip forces to measure (those in the sagittal plane) and how to measure them (using the self-selected task).
