From 2005 to 2007, I worked on robotics and augmented reality systems with the <a class="centerlink" href="http://www.shadmehrlab.org/people_page.php"> Lab for Computational Motor Control</a> on projects involving <a class="centerlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_box">phantom limb pain</a> and bilateral motor control under Reza Shadmehr.  Since 2007, I have been part of the <a class="centerlink" href= "http://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering PhD program at USC </a>  as part of the Brain Body Dynamics Lab.</p><p>I am primarily interested in sensorimotor integration and grasp planning algorithms that can be used to understand human dextrous manipulation and produce artificial dextrous manipulators for prosthetic and industrial purposes.  I am also interested in computer modelling of grasping and manipulation dynamics.   My primary research goal is to extend <a class="centerlink" href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~madhu/">Madhusudan Venkadesan's </a> thesis work on sensorimotor integration models for manipulating unstable objects. In my spare time, I take on small coding projects in making better tools for neuroscience research - such as a much faster implementation of the <a class="centerlink" href="http://mddf.usc.edu/research<html> MDDF labs' spine-like regulator </a>.  I am currently working on a <a class="centerlink> statistical learning </a>approach to synapse counting in electron microscopy images.</p><p>I would like to find more time to play with the <a class="centerlink" href ="http://linux-mm.org/">Linux kernel memory manager</a>.</p><?php include("TemplateLower.php"); ?>
