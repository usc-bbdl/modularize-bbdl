<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2017NiuJNE.pdf"target = "_blank" TITLE ="Abstract: Objective. One goal of neuromorphic engineering is to create realistic robotic systems that interact with the physical world by adopting neuromechanical principles from biology. Critical to this is the methodology to implement the spinal circuitry responsible for the behavior of afferented muscles. At its core, muscle afferentation is the closed-loop behavior arising from the interactions among populations of muscle spindle afferents, alpha and gamma motoneurons, and muscle fibers to enable useful behaviors. Approach. We used programmable Very-Large-Scale-Circuit (VLSI) hardware to implement simple models of spiking neurons, skeletal muscles, muscle spindle proprioceptors, alpha-motoneuron recruitment, gamma motoneuron control of spindle sensitivity, and the monosynaptic circuitry connecting them. This multi-scale system of populations of spiking neurons emulated the physiological properties of a pair of antagonistic afferented mammalian muscles (each simulated by 1,024 alpha- and gamma-motoneurones) acting on a joint via long tendons. Main results. This integrated system was able to maintain a joint angle, and reproduced stretch reflex responses even when driving the nonlinear biomechanics of an actual cadaveric finger. Moreover, this system allowed us to explore numerous values and combinations of gamma-static and gamma-dynamic gains when driving a robotic finger, some of which replicated some human pathological conditions. Lastly, we explored the behavioral consequences of adopting four alternative models of isometric muscle force production. We found that the dynamic responses to rate-coded spike trains produce force ramps that can be very sensitive to tendon elasticity, especially at high force output. Significance. Our methodology produced, to our knowledge, the first example of an autonomous, multi-scale, neuromorphic, neuromechanical system capable of creating realistic reflex behavior in cadaveric fingers. This research platform allows us to explore the mechanisms behind healthy and pathological sensorimotor function in the physical world by building them from first principles, and it is a precursor to neuromorphic robotic systems."> Neuromorphic meets Neuromechanics PART I: The Methodology and Implementation. </a> <br />

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2017JalaleddiniJNE.pdf"target = "_blank" TITLE ="Objective: We studied the fundamentals of muscle afferentation by building a neuro-mechano-morphic system actuating a cadaveric finger. This system is a faithful implementation of the stretch reflex circuitry. It allowed the systematic exploration of the effects of different fusimotor drives to the muscle spindle on the closed-loop stretch reflex response. Approach: As in Part I of this work, sensory neurons conveyed proprioceptive information from muscle spindles (with static and dynamic fusimotor drive) to populations of alpha-motor neurons (with recruitment and rate coding properties). The motor commands were transformed into tendon forces by a Hill-type muscle model (with activation-contraction dynamics) via brushless DC motors. Two independent afferented muscles emulated the forces of flexor digitorum profundus and the extensor indicis proprius muscles, forming an antagonist pair at the metacarpophalangeal joint of a cadaveric index finger. We measured the physical response to repetitions of bi-directional ramp-and-hold rotational perturbations for 81 combinations of static and dynamic fusimotor drives, across four ramp velocities, and three levels of constant cortical drive to the alpha-motor neuron pool. Results: We found that this system produced responses compatible with the physiological literature. Fusimotor and cortical drives had nonlinear effects on the reflex forces. In particular, only cortical drive affected the sensitivity of reflex forces to static fusimotor drive. In contrast, both static fusimotor and cortical drives reduced the sensitivity to dynamic fusimotor drive. Interestingly, realistic signal-dependent motor noise emerged naturally in our system without having been explicitly modeled. Significance: We demonstrate that these fundamental features of spinal afferentation sufficed to produce  muscle function. As such, our neuro-mechano-morphic system is a viable platform to study the spinal mechanisms for healthy muscle function -- and its pathologies such as dystonia and spasticity. In addition, it is a working prototype of a robust biomorphic controller for compliant robotic limbs and exoskeletons."> Neuromorphic meets Neuromechanics PART II: The Role of Fusimotor Drive. </a> <br />

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2016NagamoriFrontPhysiol.pdf"target = "_blank" TITLE ="Abstract: Eccentric contractions can affect musculotendon mechanical properties and disrupt muscle proprioception, but their behavioral consequences are poorly understood. We tested whether repeated eccentric contractions of plantarflexor muscles of one leg affected the dexterity of either leg. Twenty healthy male subjects (27.3 ± 4.0 yrs) compressed a compliant and slender spring prone to buckling with each isolated leg. The maximal instability they could control (i.e., the maximal average sustained compression force, or lower extremity dexterity force, LEDforce) quantified the dexterity of each leg. We found that eccentric contractions did not affect LEDforce, but reduced force variability (LEDSD). Surprisingly, LEDforce increased in the non-exposed, contralateral leg. These effects were specific to exposure to eccentric contractions because an effort-matched exposure to walking did not affect leg dexterity. In the exposed leg, eccentric contractions (i) reduced voluntary error corrections during spring compressions (i.e., reduced 0.5–4 Hz power of LEDforce); (ii) did not change spinal excitability (i.e., unaffected H-reflexes); and (iii) changed the structure of the neural drive to the α-motoneuron pool (i.e., reduced EMG power within the 4–8 Hz physiological tremor band). These results suggest that repeated eccentric contractions alter the feedback control for dexterity in the exposed leg by reducing muscle spindle sensitivity. Moreover, the unexpected improvement in LEDforce in the non-exposed contralateral leg was likely a consequence of crossed-effects on its spinal and supraspinal feedback control. We discuss the implications of these bilateral effects of unilateral eccentric contractions, their effect on spinal and supraspinal control of dynamic foot-ground interactions, and their potential to facilitate rehabilitation from"> Unilateral Eccentric Contraction of the Plantarflexors Leads to Bilateral Alterations in Leg Dexterity. </a> <br />

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2016_Valero_Robot_Assisted.pdf"target = "_blank" TITLE ="Background
Comparing the efficacy of alternative therapeutic strategies for the rehabilitation of motor function in chronically impaired individuals is often inconclusive. For example, a recent randomized clinical trial (RCT) compared robot-assisted vs. conventional therapy in 77 patients who had had chronic motor impairment after a cerebrovascular accident. While patients assigned to robotic therapy had greater improvements in the primary outcome measure (change in score on the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer assessment), the absolute difference between therapies was small, which left the clinical relevance in question.

Methods
Here we revisit that study to test whether the multidimensional rehabilitative response of these patients can better distinguish between treatment outcomes. We used principal components analysis to find the correlation of changes across seven outcome measures between the start and end of 8 weeks of therapy. Permutation tests verified the robustness of the principal components found.

Results
Each therapy in fact produces different rehabilitative trends of recovery across the clinical, functional, and quality of life domains. A rehabilitative trend is a principal component that quantifies the correlations among changes in outcomes with each therapy.

Conclusions
These findings challenge the traditional emphasis of RCTs on using a single primary outcome measure to compare rehabilitative responses that are naturally multidimensional. This alternative approach to, and interpretation of, the results of RCTs may will lead to more effective therapies targeted for the multidimensional mechanisms of recovery.">

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2016FrontComputNeuroscLaine.pdf"target = "_blank" TITLE ="Abstract: Voluntary control of force is always marked by some degree of error and unsteadiness. Both neural and mechanical factors contribute to these fluctuations, but how they interact to produce them is poorly understood. In this study, we identify and characterize a previously undescribed neuromechanical interaction where the dynamics of voluntary force production suffice to generate involuntary tremor. Specifically, participants were asked to produce isometric force with the index finger and use visual feedback to track a sinusoidal target spanning 5 to 9 % of each individual's maximal voluntary force level. Force fluctuations and EMG activity over the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscle were recorded and their frequency content was analyzed as a function target phase. Force variability in either the 1 to 5 or 6 to 15 Hz frequency ranges tended to be largest at the peaks and valleys of the target sinusoid. In those same periods, FDS EMG activity was synchronized with force fluctuations. We then constructed a physiologically-realistic computer simulation in which a muscle-tendon complex was set inside of a feedback-driven control loop. Surprisingly, the model sufficed to produce phase-dependent modulation of tremor similar to that observed in humans. Further, the gain of afferent feedback from muscle spindles was critical for appropriately amplifying and shaping this tremor. We suggest that the experimentally-induced tremor may represent the response of a viscoelastic muscle-tendon system to dynamic drive, and therefore does not fall into known categories of tremor generation, such as tremorogenic descending drive, stretch-reflex loop oscillations, motor unit behavior, or mechanical resonance. Our findings motivate future efforts to understand tremor from a perspective that considers neuromechanical coupling within the context of closed-loop control. The strategy of combining experimental recordings with physiologically-sound simulations will enable thorough exploration of neural and mechanical contributions to force control in health and disease.">

Here, we develop a mathematical framework to examine slow movements of tendon-driven limbs that are produced by modulating the tendons’ stiffness parameters. Slow limb movements are driftless in the sense that movement stops when actuations stop. We demonstrate, in the context of a planar tendon-driven system representing a finger, that the control of stiffness suffices to produce stable and accurate limb postures and quasi-static (slow) transitions among them. We prove, however, that stable postures are achievable only when tendons are pretensioned, i.e., they cannot become slack. Our results further indicate that a non-smoothness in slow movements arises because the precision with which individual stiffnesses need to be altered changes substantially throughout the limb’s motion.">

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2016_Inouye_RechingStiffness.pdf" target = "_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: Much debate has arisen from research on muscle synergies with respect to both limb impedance control and energy consumption. Studies of limb impedance control in the context of reaching movements and postural tasks have produced divergent findings, and this study explores whether the use of synergies by the central nervous system (CNS) can resolve these findings and also provide insights on mechanisms of energy consumption. In this study, we phrase these debates at the conceptual level of interactions between neural degrees of freedom and tasks constraints. This allows us to examine the ability of experimentally-observed synergies—correlated muscle activations—to control both energy consumption and the stiffness component of limb endpoint impedance. In our nominal 6-muscle planar arm model, muscle synergies and the desired size, shape, and orientation of endpoint stiffness ellipses, are expressed as linear constraints that define the set of feasible muscle activation patterns. Quadratic programming allows us to predict whether and how energy consumption can be minimized throughout the workspace of the limb given those linear constraints. We show that the presence of synergies drastically decreases the ability of the CNS to vary the properties of the endpoint stiffness and can even preclude the ability to minimize energy. Furthermore, the capacity to minimize energy consumption—when available—can be greatly affected by arm posture. Our computational approach helps reconcile divergent findings and conclusions about task-specific regulation of endpoint stiffness and energy consumption in the context of synergies. But more generally, these results provide further evidence that the benefits and disadvantages of muscle synergies go hand-in-hand with the structure of feasible muscle activation patterns afforded by the mechanics of the limb and task constraints. These insights will help design experiments to elucidate the interplay between synergies and the mechanisms of learning, plasticity, versatility and pathology in neuromuscular systems.">

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2015_Lawrence_Balance_Contributors.pdf" target = "_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: For young adults, balance is essential for participation in physical activities but is often disrupted following lower extremity injury. Clinical outcome measures such as single limb balance (SLB), Y-balance (YBT), and the single limb hop and balance (SLHB) tests are commonly used to quantify balance ability following injury. Given the varying demands across tasks, it is likely that such outcome measures provide useful, although task-specific, information. But the extent to which they are independent and contribute to understanding the multiple contributors to balance is not clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the associations among these measures as they relate to the different contributors to balance. Thirty- seven recreationally active young adults completed measures including vertical jump, YBT, SLB, SLHB, and the new Lower Extremity Dexterity test. Principal components analysis revealed that these outcome measures could be thought of as quantifying the strength, multi-joint coordination, and sensorimotor processing contributors to balance. Our results challenge the practice of using a single outcome measure to quantify the naturally multidimensional mechanisms for everyday functions such as balance. This multidimensional approach to, and interpretation of, multiple contributors to balance may lead to more effective, specialized training and rehabilitation regimens.">

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/Ko_PDDexterity.pdf" target = "_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1–2% of the population over the age of 65. Individuals with PD experience gradual deterioration of dexterous manipulation for activities of daily living; however, current clinical evaluations are mostly subjective and do not quantify changes in dynamic control of fingertip force that is critical for manual dexterity. Thus, there is a need to develop clinical measures to quantify those changes with aging and disease progression. We investigated the dynamic control of fingertip forces in both hands of 20 individuals with PD (69.0 ± 7.4 years) using the Strength–Dexterity test. The test requires low forces (<3 N) to compress a compliant and slender spring prone to buckling. A maximal level of sustained compression is informative of the greatest instability the person can control, and thus is indicative of the integrity of the neuromuscular system for dexterous manipulation. Miniature sensors recorded fingertip force (F) during maximal sustained compressions. The force variability during sustained compression was quantified in two frequency bands: low (<4 Hz, F_LF) and high (4–12 Hz, F_HF). F_LF characterizes variability in voluntary fluctuations, while F_HF characterizes variability in involuntary fluctuations including tremor. The more-affected hand exhibited significantly lower F and lower F_LF than those in the less-affected hand. The more-affected hand showed significant negative correlations between F_LF and the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor scores for both total and hand-only, suggesting that greater force variability in the voluntary range was associated with less clinical motor impairment. We conclude the nature of force variability in the voluntary range during this dynamic and dexterous task may be a biomarker of greater motor capability/flexibility/adaptability in PD. This approach may provide a more quantitative clinical assessment of changes of sensorimotor control in individuals with PD.">

We examined whether and how the associations among six hand-specific outcome measures reveal latent functional domains in elderly individuals. We asked 66 healthy older adult participants (38F, 28M, 66.1 ± 11.6 years, range: 45–88 years) and 33 older adults (65.8 ± 9.7 years, 44–81 years, 51 hands) diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) of the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint, to complete six functional assessments: hand strength (Grip, Key and Precision Pinch), Box and Block, Nine Hole Pegboard, and Strength-Dexterity tests. The first three principal components suffice to explain 86% of variance among the six outcome measures in healthy older adults, and 84% of variance in older adults with CMC OA. The composition of these dominant associations revealed three distinct latent functional domains: strength, coordinated upper extremity function, and sensorimotor processing. Furthermore, in participants with thumb CMC OA we found a blurring of the associations between the latent functional domains of strength and coordinated upper extremity function. This motivates future work to understand how the physiological effects of thumb CMC OA lead upper extremity coordination to become strongly associated with strength, while dynamic sensorimotor ability remains an independent functional domain. Thus, when assessing the level of hand function in our growing older adult populations, it is particularly important to acknowledge its multidimensional nature—and explicitly consider how each outcome measure maps to these three latent and fundamental domains of function. Moreover, this ability to distinguish among latent functional domains may facilitate the design of treatment modalities to target the rehabilitation of each of them." >

Methods: Wholebrain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was conducted in 18 healthy subjects, while they compressed an unstable spring between the thumb and index finger of the right hand. Two sensory conditions – with and without tactile input from the fingers – were employed. In the latter condition the digital nerves were blocked by local anesthesia. Results: Compression of the unstable spring was associated with activity in an earlier described network for object manipulation. We found that this entire network remained active after a nerve block, and the activity was increased in the dorsal premotor cortex. Conclusions: The neural network for dexterous manipulation is robust with only minor alterations after acute loss of tactile information from the fingers. There was no loss of activity, but, unexpectedly, an increased activity in some parts of the network. Significance: This study gives new insights to possible neural compensatory mechanisms that make fine motor control possible after acute disruption of tactile information in natural situations like cold weather or wearing surgical gloves.">

We present two such examples to explore the hypothesis of muscle redundancy. The first addresses the effect of anatomical variability on static force capabilities for three individual cat hindlimbs, each with seven kinematic degrees of freedom (DoFs) and 31 muscles. We present novel methods to characterize the structure of the 31-dimensional set of feasible muscle activations for static force production in every 3-D direction. We find that task requirements strongly define the set of feasible muscle activations and limb forces, with few differences comparing individual vs. species-average results. Moreover, muscle activity is not smoothly distributed across 3-D directions. The second example explores parameter uncertainty during a flying disc throwing motion by using a generic human arm with five DoFs and 17 muscles to predict muscle fiber velocities. We show that the measured joint kinematics fully constrain the eccentric and concentric fiber velocities of all muscles via their moment arms. Thus muscle activation for limb movements is likely not redundant: there is little, if any, latitude in synchronizing alpha-gamma motoneuron excitation-inhibition for muscles to adhere to the time-critical fiber velocities dictated by joint kinematics. Importantly, several muscles inevitably exhibit fiber velocities higher than thought tenable, even for conservative throwing speeds. These techniques and results, respectively, enable and compel us to continue to revise the classical notion of muscle redundancy for increasingly more realistic models and tasks" >

We then describe seldom measured and novel concepts embedded in two instruments; the Functional Dexterity Test (FDT) and the StrengtheDexterity (SD) Test. Discussion: The inclusion of novel yet informative tools and measurement concepts in our assessments could aid our understanding of atypical dexterity, and potentially contribute to the design of targeted therapy programs.

Physical examination, questionnaires, grip and pinch strength, Box and Blocks, 9-hole pegboard, and strength-dexterity (S-D) tests were performed. Results: Pollicized hands had poor strength and performance on functional tests. Six of 10 pollicized hands had normal dexterity scores but less stability in maintaining a steady-state force. Predictors of poorer outcomes included older age at surgery, reduced metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal range of motion, and radial absence. Discussion: Pollicization resulted in poor strength and overall function, but normal dexterity was often achieved using altered control strategies.

While most tests of hand function evaluate a combination of strength, coordination, and motor control, the Strength-Dexterity (S-D) paradigm focuses on the dynamic control of fingertip forces. We evaluated 10 pollicized and 5 non-pollicized hands from 8 participants ages 4-17 years (2 female, 6 male; 10.6 ± 4.5 years). Participants partially compressed and held an instrumented spring prone to buckling between the thumb and first finger to quantify dynamic control over the direction and magnitude of fingertip forces. They also completed traditional functional tests including grip, lateral pinch, and tripod pinch strength, Box and Blocks, and 9-hole peg test. Six of 10 pollicized hands and all non-pollicized hands had S-D scores comparable to typically developing children. However, dynamical analysis showed that pollicized hands exhibit greater variability in compression force, indicating poorer corrective action. Almost all pollicized hands scored below the normal range for the traditional functional tests. The S-D test Z-scores correlated moderately with Z-scores from the other functional tests (r=0.54-0.61; p= 0.02-0.04) but more weakly than amongst the other functional measures (r=0.58-0.83; p=0.0002-0.02), suggesting that the S-D test captures a different domain of function. A higher incidence of radial absence in the hands with poor S-D scores (3/4 vs. 0/6 in hands with normal S-D scores, p=0.03) was the only clinical characteristic associated with S-D outcome. Overall, these results suggest that while most pollicized hands can control fingertip forces, the nature of that control is altered. ">

The Strength–Dexterity paradigm consists of asking subjects to compress a slender and compliant spring prone to buckling. The maximal level of compression [requiring low fingertip forces <300 grams force (gf)] quantifies the neural control capability to dynamically regulate fingertip force vectors and motions for a dynamic manipulation task. We found that finger dexterity is significantly affected by age (p = 0.017) and gender (p = 0.021) in 147 healthy individuals (66F, 81M, 20-88 years). We then measured finger dexterity in 42 hands of patients following treatment for osteoarthritis of the base of the thumb (CMC OA, 33F, 65.8 ± 9.7 years), and 31 hands from patients being treated for Parkinson’s disease (PD, 6F, 10M, 67.68 ± 8.5 years). Importantly, we found no differences in finger compression force among patients or controls. However, we did find stronger age-related declines in performance in the patients with PD (slope -2.7 gf/year, p = 0.002) than in those with CMC OA (slope -1.4 gf/year, p = 0.015), than in controls (slope -0.86 gf/year). In addition, the temporal variability of forces during spring compression shows clearly different dynamics in the clinical populations compared to the controls (p < 0.001). Lastly, we compared dexterity across extremities. We found stronger age (p = 0.005) and gender (p = 0.002) effects of leg compression force in 188 healthy subjects who compressed a larger spring with the foot of an isolated leg (73F, 115M, 14–92 years). In 81 subjects who performed the tests with all four limbs separately, we found finger and leg compression force to be significantly correlated (females rho = 0.529, p = 0.004; males rho = 0.403, p = 0.003; 28F, 53M, 20–85 years), but surprisingly found no differences between dominant and non-dominant limbs. These results have important clinical implications, and suggest the existence - and compel the investigation - of systemic versus limb-specific mechanisms for dexterity.">

forces to examine how dexterous manipulation declines with age. Methods: The strength-dexterity (SD) test measures fingertip forces during compression of a slender spring prone to instability and buckling. The greatest sustained compression (designed to be under 3N), and force dynamics therein, have been shown to be simple and quick measures of dynamic dexterous manipulation ability. We measured pinch strength and SD test in a cross-sectional population of 98 people from 18-89 years of age. Results: Dexterous manipulation ability is poorer at older ages, beginning in middle age (p<0.001), with greater decline past 65 years of age. Fingertip force dynamics during spring compression and stabilization show a deterioration of neuromuscular control with age. Importantly, this novel detection of decline in dynamic manipulation ability is not correlated with, and thus cannot be entirely explained by, the known decline in pinch strength. We also measured standardized tests of dexterity in participants older than 45, and discuss how the SD test uniquely captures features of sensorimotor capabilities for dexterous manipulation in this adult population. Conclusions: Starting in middle age, changes in the functional interactions among sensory, motor and neural capabilities result in measurably poorer dynamic dexterous manipulation. This deterioration of neuromuscular control motivates and enables future studies to understand the physiological bases for this functional decline so critical to activities of daily living and quality of life.">

In this study we use computational modeling to both predict and optimize the grasp quality of a reconfigurable, tendon-driven hand. Our computational results show that grasp quality, measured by the radius of the largest ball in wrench space, could be improved up to 259% by simply making some pulleys smaller and redistributing the maximal tensions of the tendons. We experimentally evaluated several optimized and unoptimized designs, which had either 4, 5, or 6 tendons, and found that the theoretical calculations are effective at predicting grasp quality, with an average friction loss in this system of around 30%. We conclude that this optimization can be a very useful design tool, and that using biologically-inspired asymmetry and parameter adjustments can be used to maximize performance.">

Support for this comes from spatial domain analyses (i.e., structure of) of kinematic, kinetic and EMG variability. While proponents admit the possibility of preferential as opposed to strictly uncontrolled variables, such distinctions have only begun to be quantified or considered in the temporal domain when inferring control action. Here we extend the study of task variability during tripod static grasp to the temporal domain by
applying diffusion analysis. We show that both task-relevant and task-irrelevant parameters show corrective action at some time scales; and conversely, that task-relevant parameters do not show corrective action at other time scales. That is, the spatial fluctuations of fingertip forces show, as expected, greater ranges of variability in task-irrelevant variables (> 98% associated with changes in total grasp force; vs. only < 2% in task-relevant changes associated with acceleration of the object). But at some time scales, however, temporal fluctuations of task-irrelevant variables exhibit negative correlations clearly indicative of corrective action (scaling exponents < 0.5); and temporal fluctuations of task-relevant variables exhibit neutral and positive correlations clearly indicative of absence of corrective action (scaling exponents >= 0.5). In agreement with recent work in other behavioral contexts, these results propose we revise our understanding of variability vis-á-vis task relevance by considering both spatial and temporal features of all task variables when inferring control action and understanding how the CNS confronts task redundancy. Instead of a dichotomy of presence vs. absence of control, we should speak of a continuum of weaker to stronger—and potentially different—control strategies in specific spatiotemporal domains,
indicated here by the magnitude of deviation from the 0.5 scaling exponent. Moreover, these results are counter examples to the Uncontrolled Manifold hypothesis and the Minimal Intervention principle, and the similar nature of control actions across time scales in both task-relevant and task-irrelevant spaces points to a level of modularity not previously recognized." target="_blank">Spatio-temporal analysis reveals active control of both task-relevant and task-irrelevant variables.</a>

female athletes sustain anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears at higher rates than male athletes, and exhibit lower extremity biomechanics thought to increase
injury risk during sport maneuvers. The purpose of this study was to examine whether lower extremity dexterity (LED)—the ability to dynamically control endpoint force magnitude and direction as quantified by compressing an unstable spring
with the lower limb at submaximal forces—is a potential contributing factor to the “at-risk” movement behavior exhibited by female athletes. We tested this hypothesis by comparing LED-test performance and single-limb drop jump biomechanics between 14 female and 14 male high school soccer players.
We found that female athletes exhibited reduced LED-test performance (p=0.001) and higher limb stiffness during landing (p=0.008) calculated on average within 51 ms of foot contact. Females also exhibited higher coactivation at the ankle (p=0.001) and knee (p=0.02) before landing. No sex differences
in sagittal plane joint angles and center of mass velocity at foot contact were observed. Collectively, our results raise the possibility that the higher leg stiffness observed in females during landing is an anticipatory behavior due in part to reduced lower extremity dexterity. The

In particular, fingers are actuated by numerous muscles pulling on tendons following intricate paths. In contrast, tendondriven robotic hands with intuitive tendon routings preferred by roboticists for their ease of analysis and control do not perform at the level of their biological counterparts. Thus there is much debate on whether and how the anatomy of the human hand contributes to grasp capabilities. These parallel questions in biology and robotics arise partly because it is unclear how the number and routing of tendons offer functional benefits. We use a novel computational approach that analyzes tendon-driven
systems and quantifies grasp quality to compare the precision grasps capabilities of thousands of robotic index finger and thumb designs vs. the capabilities measured in human hands. Our exhaustive search finds that neither symmetrical designs sometimes preferred by roboticists nor randomly-generated designs approach the grasp capabilities of the human hand (they are on average 73% weaker). However, optimizing for anatomically plausible asymmetry in joint centers, tendon routings, and maximal tendon tensions produces designs that can exceed the human hand by 13-45% on average, and outperform the preferred robotic designs by up to 435%. Thus, the grasp capabilities of prosthetic or anthropomorphic hands can be greatly improved by judiciously altering design parameters, at times in counterintuitive ways. Moreover we conclude that, in addition to its other capabilities, the human hands anatomy is very advantageous for precision grasp as it greatly outperforms numerous alternative robotic designs.">

However the contributions from changes in the peripheral motor system are less well understood. Here we investigated whether there are developmental changes in muscle activation-contraction dynamics and whether these changes contribute to improvements in dynamic manipulation in humans. We compared pinch strength, dynamic manipulation ability, and contraction time of the first dorsal interosseous muscle in typically developing preadolescent, adolescent, and young adults. Both strength and dynamic manipulation ability increased with age (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.00001, respectively). Surprisingly, adults had a 33% lower muscle contraction time compared with preadolescents (p < 0.01), and contraction time showed a significant (p < 0.005) association with dynamic manipulation abilities. Whereas decreases in muscle contraction time during development have been reported in the animal literature, our finding, to our knowledge, is the first report of this phenomenon in humans and the first finding of its association with manipulation. Consequently, the changes in the muscle contractile properties could be an important complement to neural maturation in the development of dynamic manipulation. These findings have important implications for understanding central and peripheral contributors to deficits in manipulation in atypical development, such as in children with cerebral palsy.">

it is difficult to separate musculoskeletal from neural contributors to these important functional gains. This is in part due to the inability of current methods to disambiguate improvements in hand strength from gains in finger dexterity (i.e., the dynamic control of fingertip force vectors at low magnitudes). We adapted our novel instrumentation to evaluate finger dexterity
in 130 typically developing children between the ages of 4 and 16. We find that finger dexterity continues to develop well into late adolescence; and musculoskeletal growth and strength are poorly correlated with the improvements in dexterity. Importantly, because these behavioral results seem to mirror the known timelines of neuroanatomical development up to adolescence, we speculate they reflect the functional
benefits of such continual neural maturation. This novel perspective now enables the systematic study of the functional roles of specific neuroanatomical structures, their connectivity, maturity and plasticity. Moreover, the temporal dynamics of the fingertip force vectors shows improvements in stability that
provide a novel way to look at the maturation of finger control. From a clinical perspective, our results provide a practical means to chart functional development of dexterous manipulation in typically developing children, and could be adapted for clinical use, and for use in children with developmental disorders.">

lower extremity dexterity test(LED-test)óan adaptation of the StrengthñDexterity test for the fingersñ

forces. The goal of the LED-test is to sustain the highest compression force possible. Applying higher
forces makes the spring increasingly unstable, thus achieving higher compression forces represents
better ability to dynamically control instability at low force levels. As such, the LED-test provides a
novel way to quantify the capability of the lower extremity to regulate dynamic and unstable foot-

Subjects placed the thumb, index and middle fingertips on each hinged finger pad, and held it - unsupported - with constant total grasp force while voluntarily oscillating the thumbís pad. This task combines the need to (i) hold the object against gravity while (ii) dynamically reconfiguring the grasp. Fingertip force variability in this combined motion and force task exhibited strong synchrony among normal (i.e., grasp) forces. Mechanical analysis and simulation show that such synchronous variability is unnecessary and cannot be explained solely by signal dependent noise. Surprisingly, such variability also pervaded Control Tasks requiring different individuated fingertip motions and forcesóbut not tasks without finger individuation such as static grasp. These results critically extend notions of finger force variability by exposing and quantifying a pervasive challenge to dynamic multifinger manipulation: the need for the neural controller to carefully and continuously overlay individuated finger actions over mechanically unnecessary synchronous interactions. This is compatible withóand may explainóthe phenomenology of strong coupling of hand muscles when this delicate balance is not yet developed, as in early childhood, or when disrupted, as in brain injury.

We present a novel method that simultaneously estimates both the form and parameter values of arbitrary analytical expressions for tendon excursions and moment arms over the entire range of motion from sparse datasets. This symbolic regression method based on genetic programming has been shown to find the appropriate form of mathematical expressions that capture the physics of mechanical systems. We demonstrate this method by applying it to 1) experimental data from a physical tendon-driven robotic system with arbitrarily routed multiarticular tendons and 2) synthetic data from musculoskeletal models.

We use cadaveric experiments and computational models to perform a crucial thought experiment and develop an alternative explanation of how muscle synergies could be observed without the nervous system having controlled muscles in groups. We first show that the biomechanics of the limb constrains musculotendon length changes to a low-dimensional subspace across all possible movement directions. We then show that a modest assumptionóthat each muscle is independently instructed to resist length changeóleads to the result that electromyographic (EMG) synergies will arise without the need to conclude that they are a product of neural coupling among muscles. Finally, we show that there are dimensionality reducing constraints in the isometric production of force in a variety of directions, but that these constraints are more easily controlled for, suggesting new experimental directions.

Multifinger dexterous manipulation of unstable or deformable objects requires control of both direction and magnitude of fingertip force vectors. Our aim was to study
the neuroanatomical correlates of these two distinct control
functions. Brain activity was measured using functional
magnetic resonance imaging while 16 male subjects (age:
                                                   26ñ42, M = 32, SD ± 4 years) compressed four springs
representing a 2 x 2 factorial design with two levels of
force and instability requirements. Significant activations
associated with higher instability were located bilaterally in
the precentral gyri, the postcentral gyrus, and the cerebellum.
In the main effect for high force, activity was found in
areas located in the primary motor regions contralateral to
the active hand and bilaterally in the cerebellum. An
overlap in activation between the two main effects was
found bilaterally in the cerebellum (lobule VI). This study
not only confirms a recently described bilateral frontoparieto-
cerebellar network for manipulation of increasingly
unstable objects, but critically extends our understanding
by describing its differentiated modulation with both force
magnitude and instability requirements. Our results,
therefore, expose a previously unrecognized and contextsensitive

Our long-term goal is to find control principles to control robotic hands with dexterity and robustness comparable to that of the human hand. Here we explore a control strategy capable of accommodating the nonlinearities, high dimensionality and endogenous noise intrinsic to complex, tendon-driven biomechanical structures. We present the first stochastic optimal feedback controller (i.e., an iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller) applied to a tendon-driven simulated robotic index finger model. In our model we take into account both the tendon network driving of the index finger, and we consider first-order muscle dynamics. Our feedback controller shows robustness against noise and perturbation of the dynamics. Moreover, it can also successfully overcome the nonlinearities intrinsic to the mechanics of the finger for large postural changes, and the need for non-negative control signals. Our simulations provide, for the first time, the complete time history of tendon tensions, lengths and velocities for the tasks of tapping with nonzero terminal velocities required for dynamic manipulation.  We find that the optimal control of realistic tendon-driven systems fundamentally stretches current methods to their limits.  To find a successful control strategy, the algorithm must overcome several critical challenges inherent to the control of tendon-driven fingers systems in which all uni-directional control commands can actuate all joints (either directly or through dynamic coupling). Therefore, all elements of the solution are interwoven including the tuning of the cost function, the dynamics of the plant, and the initial guesses for state and control trajectories." target="_blank">Neuromuscular stochastic optimal control of a tendon-driven index finger model. </a>

It is well-known that muscle redundancy grants the CNS numerous options to perform a task. Does muscle re- dundancy, however, allow sufficient robustness to com- pensate for loss or dysfunction of even a single muscle? Are all muscles equally redundant? We combined exper- imental and computational approaches to establish the limits of motor robustness for static force production. In computer-controlled cadaveric index fingers, we find that only a small subset (<5%) of feasible forces is robust to loss of any one muscle. Importantly, the loss of cer- tain muscles compromises force production significantly more than others. Further computational modeling of a multi-joint, multi-muscle leg demonstrates that this se- vere lack of robustness generalizes to whole limbs. These results provide a biomechanical basis to begin to explain why redundant motor systems can be vulnerable to even mild neuromuscular pathology.">Muscle redundancy does not imply robustness to muscle dysfunction. </a>

Dexterous manipulation requires both strength, the ability to produce fingertip forces of a specific magnitude; and dexterity, the ability to dynamically regulate the magnitude and direction of fingertip force vectors and finger motions. While cortical activity in fronto-parietal networks has been established for stable grip and pinch forces, the cortical regulation in the dexterous control of unstable objects remains unknown. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to interrogate cortical networks engaged in the control of four objects with increasing instabilities but requiring constant strength. In addition to expected activity in fronto-parietal networks we find that dexterous manipulation of increasingly unstable objects is associated with a linear increase in the amplitude of the BOLD signal in the basal ganglia (p = 0.007 and p = 0.023 for two compression tasks). A computational regression (connectivity) model identified independent subsets of cortical networks whose connection strengths were mutable and associated with object instability (p< 0.001). Our results suggest that in the presence of object instability, the basal ganglia may modulate the activity of premotor areas and subsequent motor output. This work, therefore, provides new evidence for the selectable cortical representation and execution of dynamic multifinger manipulation for grasp stability.">Controlling instabilities in manipulation requires specific cortical-striatal-cerebellar networks.</a>

Hyperkinetic movements are unwanted or excess movements that are frequently seen in children with neurologic disorders. They are an important clinical finding with significant implications for diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of agreement on standard terminology and definitions interferes with clinical treatment and research. We describe definitions of dystonia, chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, tremor, tics, and stereotypies that arose from a consensus meeting in June 2008 of specialists from different clinical and basic science fields. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Chorea is an ongoing random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Athetosis is a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents maintenance of a stable posture. Myoclonus is a sequence of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. Tremor is a rhythmic back-and-forth or oscillating involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tics are repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. Stereotypies are repetitive, simple movements that can be voluntarily suppressed. We provide recommended techniques for clinical examination and suggestions for differentiating between the different types of hyperkinetic movements, noting that there may be overlap between conditions. These definitions and the diagnostic recommendations are intended to be reliable and useful for clinical practice, communication between clinicians and researchers, and for the design of quantitative tests that will guide and assess the outcome of future clinical trials.">Definition and Classification of Hyperkinetic Movements in Childhood.</a>

Aim:  Many everyday activities involve manipulation of objects with the fingertips. Impaired performance in manipulative tasks is common in neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus accurate assessment of an individual's ability to coordinate fingertip forces is important for planning treatment. We evaluated a recently developed assessment tool (the Strength-Dexterity Test), which is based on manipulation of unstable objects, in a paediatric population.  Method : A Rasch model was used to examine the validity and reliability of the Strength-Dexterity Test in a sample of 56 typically developing children and adolescents (30 males, 26 females; age range 4y 10mo, 17y 3mo; mean age 9y 8mo, SD 3y 8mo). In addition, we examined how performance on this test relates to widely used tests for assessment of gross manual dexterity (assessed with the Box and Blocks Test) and finger strength measured with a pinch meter. Results: The constructs measured with the 78-item Strength-Dexterity Test include dexterity and strength, and form a unique unidimensional latent trait, named fingertip force coordination, that improves with age. The test has internal scale validity when applied to a typical paediatric population. Positive correlations (significant at p<0.001) were found among all three tests. Interpretation : We provide preliminary evidence of construct validity in the Strength-Dexterity Test. Our findings suggest that this test has the potential to be developed into a promising tool for assessing dexterity in children."> Evidence of validity in a new method for measurement of dexterity in children and adolescents. </a>

We analyzed age-related changes in motor response in a visuomotor compensatory tracking task. Subjects used a manipulandum to attempt to keep a displayed cursor at the center of a screen despite random perturbations to its location. Cross-correlation analysis of the perturbation and the subject response showed no age-related increase in latency until the onset of response to the perturbation, but substantial slowing of the response itself. Results are consistent with age-related deterioration in the ratio of signal to noise in visuomotor response. The task is such that it is tractable to use Bayesian and quadratic optimality assumptions to construct a model for behavior. This model assumes that behavior resembles an optimal controller subject to noise, and parametrizes response in terms of latency, willingness to expend effort, noise intensity, and noise bandwidth. The model is consistent with the data for all young (n = 12, age 20-30) and most elderly (n = 12, age 65-92) subjects. The model reproduces the latency result from the cross-correlation method. When presented with increased noise, the computational model reproduces the experimentally observed age-related slowing and the observed lack of increased latency. The model provides a precise way to quantitatively formulate the long-standing hypothesis that age-related slowing is an adaptation to increased noise.">Slower visuomotor corrections with unchanged latency are an optimal adaptation to increased endogenous noise in the elderly.</a>

Moving our fingertips toward objects to produce well-directed forces immediately upon contact is fundamental to dexterous manipulation. This apparently simple mo- tion-to-force transition in fact involves a time-critical, predictive switch in control strategy. Given that dexterous manipulation must accommodate multiple mechanical conditions, we investigated whether and how this transition adapts to task difficulty. Eight adults (19-39 yr) produced ramps of isometric vertical fingertip force against a rigid surface immediately following a tapping motion. By changing target surface friction and size, we defined an easier (sand- paper, 11 mm diam) versus a more difficult (polished steel, 5 mm diam) task. As in prior work, we assembled fine-wire electromyograms from all seven muscles of the index finger into a seven- dimensional vector defining the full muscle coordination patterns and quantified its temporal evolution as its alignment with a reference coordination pattern vector for steady-state force production. As predicted by numerical optimizations to neuromuscular delays, our empirical and sigmoidal nonlinear regression analyses show that the coordination pattern transitions begin sooner for the more difficult tasks than for the easier tasks (~120 ms, P < 0.02, and ~115 ms, P < 0.015, respectively) and that the coordination pattern transition in alignment is well represented by a sigmoidal trend (R^2 < 0.7 in most cases). Importantly, the force vector following contact had smaller directional error (P < 0.02) for the more difficult task even though the transition in coordination pattern was less stereotypical and uniform than for the easier task. These adaptations of transition strategy to task difficulty are compatible with an optimization to counteract neuromuscular delays and noise to enable this fundamental element of dexterous manipulation.">The anticipatory control of motion-to-force transitions with the fingertips adapts optimally to task difficulty.</a>

Numerous studies of limbs and fingers propose that force and velocity properties of muscle limit maximal voluntary force production during anisometric tasks, i.e., when muscles are shortening or lengthening. Although this proposition appears logical, our study on the simultaneous production of fingertip motion and force disagrees with this commonly held notion. We asked eight consenting adults to use their dominant index fingertip to maximize voluntary downward force against a horizontal surface at specific postures (static trials), and also during an anisometric scratching task of rhythmically moving the fingertip along a 5.8 ± 0.5 cm target line. The metronome-timed flexion-extension movement speed varied 36-fold from 'slow' (1.0 ± 0.5 cm/s) to 'fast' (35.9 ± 7.8 cm/s). As expected, maximal downward voluntary force diminished (44.8 ± 15.6%; p = 0.001) when any motion (slow or fast) was added to the task. Surprisingly, however, a 36-fold increase in speed did not affect this reduction in force magnitude. These remarkable results for such an ordinary task challenge the dominant role often attributed to force-velocity properties of muscle and provide insight into neuromechanical interac- tions. We propose an explanation that the simultaneous enforcement of mechanical constraints for motion and force reduces the set of feasible motor commands sufficiently so that force-velocity properties cease to be the force-limiting factor. While additional work is necessary to reveal the governing mechanisms, the dramatic influence that the simultaneous enforcement of motion and force con- straints has on force output begins to explain the vulnerability of dexterous function to development, aging, and even mild neuromus- cular pathology.">Maximal voluntary fingertip force production is not limited by movement speed in combined motion and force tasks.</a>

Numerous observations of structured motor variability indicate that the sensorimotor system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters while allowing task-irrelevant ones to fluctuate. Optimality models show that controlling a redundant musculo-skeletal system in this manner meets task demands while minimizing control effort. Although this line of inquiry has been very productive, the data are mostly behavioral with no direct physiological evidence on the level of muscle or neural activity. Furthermore, biomechanical coupling, signal-dependent noise, and alternative causes of trial-to-trial variability confound behavioral studies. Here we address those confounds and present evidence that the nervous system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters on the muscle level. We asked subjects to produce vertical fingertip force vectors of prescribed constant or time-varying magnitudes while maintaining a constant finger posture. We recorded intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously from all seven index finger muscles during this task. The experiment design and selective fine-wire muscle recordings allowed us to account for a median of 91% of the variance of fingertip forces given the EMG signals. By analyzing muscle coordination in the seven-dimensional EMG signal space, we find that variance-per-dimension is consistently smaller in the task-relevant subspace than in the task-irrelevant subspace. This first direct physiological evidence on the muscle level for preferential control of task-relevant parameters strongly suggest the use of a neural control strategy compatible with the principle of minimal intervention. Additionally, variance is nonnegligible in all seven dimensions, which is at odds with the view that muscle activation patterns are composed from a small number of synergies.">Structured variability of muscle activations supports the

The field of complex biomechanical modeling has begun to rely on Monte Carlo techniques to investigate the effects of parameter variability and measurement uncertainty on model outputs, search for optimal parameter combinations, and define model limitations. However, advanced stochastic methods to perform data-driven explorations, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), become necessary as the number of model parameters increases. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and, what to our knowledge is, the first use of an MCMC approach to improve the fitness of realistically large biomechanical models. We used a MetropolisñHastings algorithm to search increasingly complex parameter landscapes (3, 8, 24, and 36 dimensions) to uncover underlying distributions of anatomical parameters of a ìtruth modelî of the human thumb on the basis of simulated kinematic data (thumbnail location, orientation, and linear and angular velocities)polluted by zero-mean, uncorrelated multivariate Gaussian ìmeasurement noise.î Driven by these data, ten Markov chains searched each model parameter space for the subspace that best fit the data (posterior distribution). As expected, the convergence time increased, more local minima were found, and marginal distributions broadened as the parameter space complexity increased. In the 36-D scenario, some chains found local minima but the majority of chains converged to the true posterior distribution (confirmed using a cross-validation dataset), thus demonstrating the feasibility and utility of these methods for realistically large biomechanical problems.">Improving the Fitness of High-dimensional Biomechanical Models via Data-driven Stochastic Exploration.</a>

Researchers and clinicians routinely rely on interference electromyograms (EMGs) to estimate muscle forces and command signals in the neuromuscular system (e.g., amplitude, timing, and frequency content). The amplitude cancellation intrinsic to interference EMG, however, raises important questions about how to optimize these estimates. For example, what should the length of the epoch (time window) be to average an EMG signal to reliably estimate muscle forces and command signals? Shorter epochs are most practical, and significant reductions in epoch have been reported with high-pass filtering and whitening. Given that this processing attenuates power at frequencies of interest (< 250 Hz), however, it is unclear how it improves the extraction of physiologically-relevant information. We examined the influence of amplitude cancellation and high-pass filtering on the epoch necessary to accurately estimate the true average EMG amplitude calculated from a 28 s EMG trace (EMGref) during simulated constant isometric conditions. Monte Carlo iterations of a motor-unit model simulating 28 s of surface EMG produced 245 simulations under 2 conditions: with and without amplitude cancellation. For each simulation, we calculated the epoch necessary to generate average full-wave rectified EMG amplitudes that settled within 5% of EMGref. For the no-cancellation EMG, the necessary epochs were short (e.g., < 100 ms). For the more realistic interference EMG (i.e., cancellation condition), epochs shortened dramatically after using high-pass filter cutoffs above 250 Hz, producing epochs short enough to be practical (i.e., < 500 ms). We conclude that the need to use long epochs to accurately estimate EMG amplitude is likely the result of unavoidable amplitude cancellation, which helps to clarify why high-pass filtering > 250 Hz improves EMG estimates." > Epoch length to accurately estimate the amplitude of interference EMG is likely the result of unavoidable amplitude cancellation.</a>

We present a numerical exploration of contact transitions with the fingertip. When picking up objects our fingertips must make contact at specific locations, and upon contact maintain posture while producing well directed force vectors. However, the joint torques for moving the fingertip towards a surface (tm) are different from those for producing static force vectors (tf). We previously described the neural control of such abrupt transitions in humans, and found that unavoidable errors arise because sensorimotor time delays and lags prevent an instantaneous switch between different torques. Here, we use numerical optimization on a finger model to reveal physical bounds for controlling such rapid contact transitions. Resembling human data, it is necessary to anticipatorily switch joint torques to tf at about 30 ms before contact to minimize the initial misdirection of the fingertip force vector. This anticipatory strategy arises in our deterministic model from neuromuscular lags, and not from optimizing for robustness to noise/uncertainties. Importantly, the optimal solution also leads to a tradeoff between the speed of force magnitude increase versus the accuracy of initial force direction. This is an alternative to prevailing theories that propose multiplicative noise in muscles as the driver of speed-accuracy tradeoffs. We instead find that the speed-accuracy tradeoff arises solely from neuromuscular lags. Finally, because our model intentionally uses idealized assumptions, its agreement with human data suggests that the biological system is controlled in a way that approaches the physical boundaries of performance."> Effects of neuromuscular lags on controlling contact transitions.</a>

Studies of the degrees of freedom and synergies in musculoskeletal systems rely critically on algorithms to estimate the 'dimension' of kinematic or neural data. Linear algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) are the most popular. However, many biological data (or realistic experimental data) may be better represented by nonlinear sets than linear subspaces. We evaluate the performance of PCA and compare it to two nonlinear algorithms [Isomap and our novel pointwise dimension estimation (PD-E)] using synthetic and motion capture data from a robotic arm with known kinematic dimensions, as well as motion capture data from human hands. We find that PCA can lead to more accurate dimension estimates when considering additional properties of the PCA residuals, instead of the dominant method of using a threshold of variance captured. In contrast to the single integer dimension estimates of PCA and Isomap, PD-E provides a distribution and range of estimates of fractal dimension that identify the heterogeneous geometric structure in the experimental data. A strength of the PD-E method is that it associates a distribution of dimensions to the data. Since there is no a priori reason to assume that the sets of interest have a single dimension, these distributions incorporate more information than a single summary statistic. Our preliminary findings suggest that fewer than ten DOFs are involved in some hand motion tasks. Contrary to common opinion regarding fractal dimension methods, PD-E yielded reasonable results with reasonable amounts of data. Given the complex nature of experimental and biological data, we conclude that it is necessary and feasible to complement PCA with methods that take into consideration the nonlinear properties of biological systems for a more robust estimation of their DOFs."> Estimating effective degrees of freedom in motor systems.</a>

The neural control of tasks such as rapid acquisition of precision pinch remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the neural control of finger musculature when the index fingertip abruptly transitions from motion to static force production. Nine subjects produced a downward tapping motion followed by vertical fingertip force against a rigid surface. We simultaneously recorded three-dimensional fingertip force, plus the complete muscle coordination pattern using intramuscular electromyograms from all seven index finger muscles. We found that the muscle coordination pattern clearly switched from that for motion to that for isometric force ~65 ms before contact ( p < 0.0004). Mathematical modeling and analysis revealed that the underlying neural control also switched between mutually incompatible strategies in a time-critical manner. Importantly, this abrupt switch in underlying neural control polluted fingertip force vector direction beyond what is explained by muscle activation-contraction dynamics and neuromuscular noise ( p < 0.003). We further ruled out an impedance control strategy in a separate test showing no systematic change in initial force magnitude for catch trials where the tapping surface was surreptitiously lowered and raised ( p < 0.93). We conclude that the nervous system predictively switches between mutually incompatible neural control strategies to bridge the abrupt transition in mechanical constraints between motion and static force. Moreover because the nervous system cannot switch between control strategies instantaneously or exactly, there arise physical limits to the accuracy of force production on contact. The need for such a neurally demanding and time-critical strategy for routine motion-to-force transitions with the fingertip may explain the existence of specialized neural circuits for the human hand."> Neural Control of Motion-to-Force Transitions with the Fingertip.</a>

Computational models of motor-unit populations are the objective implementations of the hypothesized mechanisms by which neural and muscle properties give rise to electromyograms (EMGs) and force. However, the variability/uncertainty of the parameters used in these models  and how they affect predictions confounds assessing these hypothesized mechanisms. We perform a large-scale computational sensitivity analysis on the state-of-the-art computational model of surface EMG, force, and force variability by combining a comprehensive review of published experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations. To exhaustively explore model performance and robustness, we ran numerous iterative simulations each using a random set of values for nine commonly measured motor neuron and muscle parameters. Parameter values were sampled across their reported experimental ranges. Convergence after 439 simulations found that only 3 simulations met our two fitness criteria: approximating the well-established experimental relations for the scaling of EMG amplitude and force variability with mean force. An additional 424 simulations preferentially sampling the neighborhood of those 3 valid simulations converged to reveal 65 additional sets of parameter values for which the model predictions approximate the experimentally known relations. We find the model is not sensitive to muscle properties but very sensitive to several motor neuron properties, especially peak dis- charge rates and recruitment ranges. Therefore to advance our under- standing of EMG and muscle force, it is critical to evaluate the hypothesized neural mechanisms as implemented in today's state-of- the-art models of motor unit function. We discuss experimental and analytical avenues to do so as well as new features that may be added in future implementations of motor-unit models to improve their experimental validity."> Experimentally-valid predictions of muscle force and EMG in models of motor unit function are most sensitive to neural properties.</a>

Selecting a model topology that realistically predicts biomechanical function remains an unsolved problem.  Todayís dominant modeling approach is to replicate experimental input/output data by performing parameter estimation on an assumed topology. In contrast, we propose that modeling some complex biomechanical systems requires the explicit and simultaneous exploration of model topology (i.e., the type, number, and organization of physics-based functional building blocks)and parameter values. In this paper, we use the example of modeling the notoriously complex tendon networks of the fingers to present three critical advances towards the goal of implementing this extended modeling paradigm. First, we describe a novel computational environment to perform quasi-static simulations of arbitrary topologies of elastic structures undergoing large deformations. Second, we use this form of simulation to show that the assumed topology for the tendon network of a finger plays an important role in the propagation of tension to the finger joints.  Third, we demonstrate the use of a novel inference algorithm that simultaneously explores the topology and parameter values for hidden synthetic tendon networks. We conclude by discussing critical issues of observability, separability, and uniqueness of topological features inferred from input/output data, and outline the challenges that need to be overcome to apply this novel modeling paradigm to extract causal models in real anatomical systems.">Beyond parameter estimation: Extending biomechanical modeling by the explicit exploration of model topology.</a>

We investigate the integration of visual and tactile sensory input for dynamic manipulation. Our experimental data and computational modeling reveal that time-delays are as critical to task-optimal multisensory integration as sensorimotor noise. Our focus is a dynamic manipulation task ëëat the edge of instability.íí Mathematical bifurcation theory predicts that this system will exhibit well-classified lowdimensional dynamics in this regime. The task was using the thumbpad to compress a slender spring prone to buckling as far as possible, just shy of slipping. As expected from bifurcation theory, principal components analysis gives a projection of the data onto a low dimensional subspace that captures 91ñ97% of its variance. In this subspace, we formulate a low-order model for the brain+hand+spring dynamics based on known mechanical and neurophysiological properties of the system. By systematically occluding vision and anesthetically blocking thumbpad sensation in 12 consenting subjects, we found that vision contributed to dynamic manipulation only when thumbpad sensation was absent. The reduced ability of the model system to compress the spring with absent sensory channels closely resembled the experimental results. Moreover, we found that the model reproduced the contextual usefulness of vision only if we took account of time-delays. Our results shed light on critical features of dynamic manipulation distinct from those of static pinch, as well as the mechanism likely responsible for loss of manual dexterity and increased reliance on vision when age or neuromuscular disease increase noisiness and/or time-delays during sensorimotor integration.">Manipulating the edge of instability.</a>

Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the propor- tion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal inter- phalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information pro- cessing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural 'somatic logic' found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks."> The tendon network of the fingers performs anatomical computation at a macroscopic scale.</a>

The static properties of tensegrity structures have been widely appreciated in civil engineering as the basis of extremely lightweight yet strong mechanical structures. However,the dynamic properties and their potential utility in the design of robots have been relatively unexplored. This paper introduces robots based on tensegrity structures, which demonstrate that the dynamics of such structures can be utilized for locomotion.  Two tensegrity robots are presented: TR3, based on a triangular tensegrity prism with three struts, and TR4, based on a quadrilateral tensegrity prism with four struts. For each of these robots, simulation models are designed, and automatic design of controllers for forward locomotion are performed in simulation using evolutionary algorithms. The evolved controllers are shown to be able to produce static and dynamic gaits in both robots. A real-world tensegrity robot is then developed based on one of the simulation models as a proof of concept. The results demonstrate that tensegrity structures can provide the basis for lightweight, strong, and fault-tolerant robots with a potential for a variety of locomotor gaits."> Design and Control of locomotive tensegrity robots. </a>

A realistic biomechanical thumb model would elucidate the functional consequences of orthopedic and neurological diseases and their treatments. We investigated whether a single parametric kinematic model can represent all thumbs, or whether different kinematic model structures are needed to represent different thumbs. We used Monte Carlo simulations to convert the anatomical variability in the kinematic model parameters into distributions of DenavitñHartenberg parameters amenable for robotics-based models. Upon convergence (3550 simulations, where mean and coefficient of variance changed 1% for the last 20 +% simulations) the distributions of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters appeared multimodal, in contrast to the reported unimodal distributions of the anatomy-based parameters. Cluster analysis and one-way analysis of variance confirmed four types of kinematic models ( p < 0.0001) differentiated primarily by the biomechanically relevant order of MCP joint axes (in 65.2% of models, the flexion-extension axis was distal to the adduction-abduction axis); and secondarily by a detail specifying the direction of a common normal between successive axes of rotation.  Importantly, this stochastic analysis of anatomical variability redefines the debate on whether a single generic biomechanical model can represent the entire population, or if subject-specific models are necessary. We suggest a practical third alternative: that anatomical and functional variability can be captured by a finite set of model-types.">Reported anatomical variability naturally leads to multimodal distributions of Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for the human thumb.</a>

Models of motor guidance that dynamically adjust to the availability and quality of sensory information are based on the observation that dexterous tasks are routinely performed using various combinations of visual and tactile inputs. However, a dynamic neural system that acquires and processes relevant visual and tactile information remains relatively uncharacterized in humans. In this study, whole-brain functional magnetic resonance images were acquired during a dexterous manipulation task, compression of the end caps of a slender spring prone to buckling, to investigate the neural systems associated with motor guidance under four visual and tactile guidance conditions: (1) eyes closed (no visual input), smooth end caps, (2) eyes dosed, rough end caps, (3) eyes open and watching hand, smooth end caps, and (4) eyes open and watching hand, rough end caps. Performance of the dexterous task remained constant in all conditions. Variations in the two levels of visual input resulted in modulation of activity in the middle and inferior occipital gyrii and inferior parietal lobule, and variation in the two levels of tactile input during the task resulted in modulation of activity in the precentral (primary motor) gyrus. Although significantly active in all conditions, cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and cerebellum activities were not modulated by levels of either visual or somatosensory input, and no interaction effects were observed. Together, these data indicate that a fine-tuned motor task guided by varying visual and tactile information engages a distributed and integrated neural complex consisting of control and executive functions and regions that process dynamic sensory information related to guidance functions.">Visual and Tactile Guidance of Dexterous Manipulation Tasks: an fMRI Study.</a>

The exquisite mechanical functionality and versatility of the human hand emerges from complex neuro-musculo-skeletal interactions that are not completely understood. I have found it useful to work within a theoretical/experimental paradigm that outlines the fundamental neuro-musculo-skeletal components and their interactions. In this integrative paradigm, the laws of mechanics, the specifications of the manipulation task, and the sensorimotor signals define the interactions among hand anatomy, the nervous system, and manipulation function. Thus, our collaborative research activities emphasize a firm grounding in the mechanics of finger function, insistence on anatomical detail, and meticulous characterization of muscle activity. This overview of our work on precision pinch (i.e., the ability to produce and control fingertip forces) presents some of our findings around three Research Themes: Mechanics-based quantification of manipulation ability; Anatomically realistic musculoskeletal finger models; and Neural control of finger muscles. I conclude that (i) driving the fingers to some limit of sensorimotor performance is instrumental to elucidating motor control strategies; (ii) that the cross-over of tendons from flexors to extensors in the extensor mechanism is needed to produce force in every direction, and (iii) the anatomical routing of multiarticular muscles makes co-contraction unavoidable for many tasks. Moreover, creating realistic and clinically useful finger models still requires developing new computational means to simulate the viscoelastic tendinous networks of the extensor mechanism, and the muscle-bone-ligament interactions in complex articulations. Building upon this neuromuscular biomechanics paradigm is of immense clinical relevance: it will be instrumental to the development of clinical treatments to preserve and restore manual ability in people suffering from neurological and orthopedic conditions. This understanding will also advance the design and control of robotic hands whose performance lags far behind that of their biological counterparts."> An integrative approach to the biomechanical function and neuromuscular control of the fingers.</a>

Three geometric properties of the force convex hull characterized each cross-section's shape: the ratios of its principal moments of inertia (RPMIs), the orientation of its principal axis (OPA), and its centroid location. Our results show that force production in the thumb's sagittal plane may be a reproducible and objective test to grade motor impairment in LUNP: paired t-tests of the larger RPMI in this plane best distinguished the nerve-blocked cases from the control cases in the guided task (p = 0.012), and Discriminant Analysis of the centroid location for the self-selected task in this plane correctly classified 94.7% of subjects into the control and ulnar nerve-blocked groups.

A rigorous description of the magnitude and direction of the 3D force vector each thumb muscle produces at the thumb-tip is necessary to understand the biomechanical consequences to pinch of a variety of paralyses and surgical procedures (such as tendon transfers). In this study, we characterized the 3D force vector each muscle produces at the thumb-tip, and investigated if these thumb-tip force vectors scaled linearly with tendon tension. In 13 cadaver specimens, we measured the output 3D thumb-tip force vector produced by each tendon acting on the thumb, plus two common tendon transfers, as a function of input tendon tension.  After fixing the hand to a rigid frame, we mounted the thumb by configuring it in standardized key or opposition pinch posture and coupling the thumb-tip to a rigidly held 6 degree-of-freedom force/torque sensor. Linear actuators applied tension to the distal tendons of the four extrinsic thumb muscles, and to six Nylon cords reproducing the lines of action of (i) the four intrinsic thumb muscles and (ii) two alternative tendon transfers commonly used to restore thumb opposition following low median nerve palsy.  Each computer-controlled linear actuator ramped tendon tension from zero to 1/3 of predicted maximal muscle force expected at each tendon, and back to zero, while we measured the 3D force vector at the thumb-tip. In test/re-test trials, we saw thumb-tip force vectors were quite sensitive to mounting procedure, but also sensitive to variations in the seating of joint surfaces. We found that: (i)some thumb-tip force vectors act in unexpected directions (e.g., the opponens force vector is parallel to the distal phalanx), (ii) the two tendon transfers produced patently different force vectors, and (iii) for most muscles, thumb-tip force vectors do not scale linearly with tendon tensionññlikely due to load-dependent viscoelastic tendon paths, joint seating and/or bone motion. Our 3D force vector data provide the first quantitative reference descriptions of the thumb-tip force vectors produced by all thumb muscles and two tendon transfers. We conclude that it may not be realistic to assume in biomechanical models that thumb-tip force vectors scale linearly with tendon tensions, and that our data suggest the thumb may act as a ëëfloating digitíí affected by load-dependent trapezium motion.">The fundamental thumb-tip force vectors produced by the muscles of the thumb.</a>

A biomechanical model of the thumb can help researchers and clinicians understand the clinical problem of how anatomical variability contributes to the variability of outcomes of surgeries to restore thumb function. We lacka realistic biomechanical model of the thumb because of the variability/uncertainty of musculoskeletal parameters, the multiple proposed kinematic descriptions and methods to solve the muscle redundancy problem, and the paucity of data to validate the model with in vivo coordination patterns and force output. We performed a multi-stage validation of a biomechanical computer model against our measurements of maximal static thumbtip force and fine-wire electromyograms (EMG) from 8 thumb muscles in each of five orthogonal directions in key and opposition pinch postures. A low-friction point-contact at the thumbtip ensured that subjects did not produce thumbtip torques during force production. The 3-D, 8-muscle biomechanical thumb model uses a 5-axis kinematic description with orthogonal and intersecting axes of rotation at the carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints. We represented the 50 musculoskeletal parameters of the model as stochastic variables based on experimental data, and ran Monte Carlo simulations in the ëëinverseíí and ëëforwardíí directions for 5000 random instantiations of the model. Two inverse simulations (predicting the distribution of maximal static thumbtip forces and the muscle activations that maximized force) showed that: the model reproduces at most 50% of the 80 EMG distributions recorded (eight muscle excitations in 5 force directions in two postures); and well-directed thumbtip forces of adequate magnitude are predicted only if accompanied by unrealistically large thumbtip torques (0.64+- 0.28Nm). The forward simulation (which fed the experimental distributions of EMG through random instantiations of the model) resulted in misdirected thumbtip force vectors (within 74.3+-24.5. from the desired direction) accompanied by doubly large thumbtip torques (1.32+- 0.95Nm). Taken together, our results suggest that the variability and uncertainty of musculoskeletal parameters and the
choice of solution method are not the likely reason for the unrealistic predictions obtained. Rather, the kinematic description of the
thumb we used is not representative of the transformation of net joint torques into thumbtip forces/torques in the human thumb.">Towards a realistic biomechanical model of the thumb: The choice of kinematic description may be more critical than the solution method or the variability/uncertainty of musculoskeletal parameters.</a>

We have developed a method to quantify the dynamic interaction between fingertip force magnitude (strength) and directional control (dexterity) during pinch with a novel strengthñdexterity (SñD) test based on the principle of buckling of compression springs. The test consists of asking participants to use key and opposition pinch to attempt to fully compress springs, in random order, with a wide range of combinations of strength and dexterity requirements. The minimum force required to fully compress the spring and the propensity of the spring to buckle define the strength and dexterity requirements, respectively. The SñD score for each pinch style was the sum of the strength values of all springs successfully compressed fully. We tested 3 participant groups: 18 unimpaired young adults (<=40 yr), 10 unimpaired older adults (>40 yr), and 14 adults diagnosed with carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA)(>=36 yr). We investigated the repeatability of the SñD test with 74 springs by testing 14 young adults twice on different days. The per-spring repeatability across subjects was >=94%. A minimum performance score for young adults was found as they all could compress a subset of 39 springs. Using this subset of springs, we compared the ability of the SñD score vs. maximal pinch force values to distinguish unimpaired hands from those with CMC OA of the thumb. The score for this 39-spring SñD test distinguished between CMC OA and asymptomatic older adults, whereas pinch meter readings did not (p<0:05). We conclude that the SñD test is repeatable and applicable to clinical research. We propose including the SñD test in studies aiming to quantify impairment and compare treatment outcomes in orthopaedic and neurological afflictions that degrade dynamic manipulation.">The strength-dexterity test as a measure of dynamic pinch performance. </a>

Objective estimates of fingertip force magnitude following surgery to prevent digital metacarpophalangeal (MCP) hyperextension (clawing) in cases of paralysis of the handís intrinsic muscles will assist clinicians in setting realistic expectations for post-operative pinch strength. We used a cadaveric/optimization approach to predict and confirm the maximal biomechanically possible fingertip force in the intrinsic palsied hand before and after two popular tendon transfer methods to the volar plate of the MCP joint. Both surgeries were also evaluated after release of the A3 pulleyñña modification predicted by our published computer model of the forefinger to increase fingertip force magnitude. We predicted maximal static fingertip force by mounting eight fresh cadaveric hands on a frame, placing their forefinger in a functional posture (neutral abduction, 45 degrees of flexion at the MCP and proximal inter-phalangeal joints, and 10 degrees at the distal interphalangeal joint) and pinning the distal phalanx to a 3D dynamometer. We pulled on individual tendons with tensions up to 25% of maximal isometric force of their associated muscle and measured fingertip force and torque output. Using these measurements, we predicted the optimal combination of tendon tensions that maximized palmar force (analogous to pinch force, directed perpendicularly from the midpoint of the distal phalanx, and in the plane of finger flexion-extension) for four cases: (i) the non-paretic case (all muscles available), (ii) intrinsic palsied hand (no intrinsic muscles functioning), (iii) transfer of flexor superficialis tendon to the volar plate of the MCP (Zancolli lasso) in the intrinsic palsied hand, and (iv) leaving flexor superficialis intact and transferring a tendon of comparable strength to the volar plate of the MCP in the intrinsic palsied hand. Lastly, we applied these optimal combinations of tension to the cadaveric tendons and measured fingertip output. With the A3 pulley intact, the maximal palmar force in cases (ii)ñ(iv) averaged 48 +- 23% SD (non-paretic = 100%; case (iv)(61 +- 25%) > cases (ii) and (iii) (43 +- 23% and 39 +- 19%, respectively), p < 0:05). Releasing the A3 pulley significantly increased the average palmar force in cases (ii)ñ(iv) (73 +- 42%, p < 0:05), with no significant differences among them. Thus, releasing the A3 pulley may improve palmar force magnitude when it is necessary to transfer the digitís own flexor superficialis tendon to the volar plate of the MCP to prevent clawing in the intrinsic palsied hand.">Releasing the A3 pulley and leaving flexor superficialis intact increase palmar force following the Zancolli lasso procedures to prevent claw deformity in the intrinsic minus hand. </a>

The ability to direct forces between the thumb and fingers is important to secure objects in the hand. We compared the coordination of thumb musculature in key and opposition pinch postures between stable and unstable tasks. The unstable task (producing thumb-tip force wearing a beaded thimble) required well-directed forces; the stable task (producing thumb-tip force against a pinch meter) did not. Fine-wire electromyography of thumb muscles and thumb-tip force magnitudes were recorded. We found no statistical differences in thumb-tip force between postures or stable versus unstable tasks, indicating that the highest magnitudes of force can be accurately directed. Abductor pollicis brevis and extensor pollicis longus were significantly more activated in the unstable tasks, suggesting their importance in directing thumb-tip force. Understanding how pinch forces are directed might influence the choice of muscleñtendon transfers performed to restore function to the severely paralyzed thumb. We introduce a device to quantify the ability to control pinch force magnitude and direction simultaneously.">Activation patterns of the thumb muscles during stable and unstable pinch tasks.</a>

Objective estimates of fingertip force reduction following peripheral nerve injuries would assist clinicians in setting realistic expectations for rehabilitating strength of grasp. We quantified the reduction in fingertip force that can be biomechanically attributed to paralysis of the groups of muscles associated with low radial and ulnar palsies. We mounted 11 fresh cadaveric hands (5 right, 6 left)on a frame, placed their forefingers in a functional posture (neutral abduction, 453 of flexion at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and 103 at the distal interphalangeal joint) and pinned the distal phalanx to a six-axis dynamometer. We pulled on individual tendons with tensions up to 25% of maximal isometric force of their associated muscle and measured fingertip force and torque output. Based on these measurements, we predicted the optimal combination of tendon tensions that maximized palmar force (analogous to tip pinch force, directed perpendicularly from the midpoint of the distal phalanx, in the plane of finger flexion}extension) for three cases: non-paretic (all muscles of forefinger available), low radial palsy (extrinsic extensor muscles unavailable) and low ulnar palsy (intrinsic muscles unavailable). We then applied these combinations of tension to the cadaveric tendons and measured fingertip output. Measured palmar forces were within 2% and 53 of the predicted magnitude and direction, respectively, suggesting tendon tensions superimpose linearly in spite of the complexity of the extensor mechanism. Maximal palmar forces for ulnar and radial palsies were 43 and 85% of non-paretic magnitude, respectively (p<0.05). Thus, the reduction in tip pinch strength seen clinically in low radial palsy may be partly due to loss of the biomechanical contribution of forefinger extrinsic extensor muscles to palmar force. Fingertip forces in low ulnar palsy were 93 further from the desired palmar direction than the non-paretic or low radial palsy cases (p<0.05).">Quantification of fingertip force reduction in the forefinger following simulated paralysis of extensor and intrinsic muscles. </a>

Given the biomechanical complexity of the human hand, it is not surprising that the grasping ability of individuals after treatment for severe paralysis or injury can seldom be restored to the level of the 'normal' hand.  Improving clinical outcomes will require i) developing experimental paradigms to evaluate hand function objectively, ii) understanding how the nervous system controls the redundant musculature of the digits, and iii)increasing the clinical impact of computer biomechanical models by validating their anatomical assumptions.  Recognizing that the human hand is also a mechanical system, the principles of robotics developed Jbr the analysis of manipulators can be applied to each of these three clinical challenges.

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/valero-CuevasJNP2000.pdf" target="_blank" TITLE="Abstract:
Human fingers have sufficiently more muscles than joints such that every fingertip force of submaximal magnitude can be produced by an infinite number of muscle coordination patterns. Nevertheless, the nervous system seems to effortlessly select muscle coordination patterns when sequentially producing fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude. The hypothesis of this study is that the selection of coordination patterns to produce submaximal forces is simplified by the appropriate modulation of the magnitude of a muscle coordination pattern capable of producing the largest expected fingertip force. In each of three directions, eight subjects were asked to sequentially produce fingertip forces of low, moderate, and maximal magnitude with their dominant forefinger. Muscle activity was described by fine-wire electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously collected from all muscles of the forefinger. A muscle coordination pattern was defined as the vector list of the EMG activity of each muscle. For all force directions, statistically significant muscle coordination patterns simi- lar to those previously reported for 100% of maximal fingertip forces were found for 50% of maximal voluntary force. Furthermore the coordination pattern and fingertip force vector magnitudes were highly correlated (r > 0.88). Average coordination pattern vectors at 50 and 100% of maximal force were highly correlated with each other, as well as with individual coordination pattern vectors in the ramp transitions preceding them. In contrast to this consistency of EMG coordination patterns, predictions using a musculoskeletal computer model of the forefinger show that force magnitudes <=50% of maximal fingertip force can be produced by coordination patterns drastically different from those needed for maximal force. Thus when modulating fingertip force magnitude across the voluntary range, the number of contributing muscles and the relative activity among them was not changed. Rather, the production of low and moderate forces seems to be simplified by appropriately scaling the magnitude of a coordination pattern capable of producing the highest force expected."> Predictive modulation of muscle coordination pattern magnitude scales fingertip force magnitude over the voluntary range.</a>

Are fingertip forces produced by subject-independent patterns of muscle excitation? If so, understanding themechanical basis underlying these muscle coordination strategies would greatly assist surgeons in evaluating options for restoring grasping. With the finger in neutral ad- abduction and flexed 45∞ at the MCP and PIP, and 10∞ at DIP joints, eight subjects attempted to produce maximal voluntary forces in four orthogonal directions perpendicular to the distal phalanx (palmar, dorsal, lateral and medial) and in one direction collinear with it (distal). Forces were directed within 4.7±2.2∞ (mean ± S.D.) of target and their magnitudes clustered into three distinct levels (p<0.05; post hoc pairwise RMANOVA). Palmar (27.9±4.1N), distal (24.3±8.3N) and medial (22.9±7.8 N) forces were highest, lateral (14.7±4.8 N) was intermediate, and dorsal (7.5±1.5 N) was lowest. Normalized fine-wire EMGs from all seven muscles revealed distinct muscle excitation groups for palmar, dorsal and distal forces (p<0.05; post hoc pairwise RMANOVA). Palmar force used flexors, extensors and dorsal interosseous; dorsal force used all muscles; distal force used all muscles except for extensors; medial and lateral forces used all muscles including significant co-excitation of interossei. The excitation strategies predicted to achieve maximal force by a 3-D computer model (four pin joints, inextensible tendons, extensor mechanism and isometric force models for all seven muscles) reproduced the observed use of extensors and absence of palmar interosseous to produce palmar force (to regulate net joint flexion torques), the absence of extensors for distal force, and the use of intrinsics (strong MCP flexors) for dorsal force. The model could not predict the interossei co-excitation seen for medial and lateral forces, which may be a strategy to prevent MCP joint damage. The model predicts distal force to be most sensitive to dorsal interosseous strength, and palmar and distal forces to be very sensitive to MCP and PIP flexor moment arms, and dorsal force to be sensitive to the moment arm of and the tension allocation to the PIP extensor tendon of the extensor mechanism."> Large index-fingertip forces are produced by subject-independent patterns of muscle excitation.</a>

When accurately placed, fine-wire electrodes (FWEs) permit selective electromyographic recording during kinesiologic studies; however, their potential to limit contraction of the index finger muscles has not previously been evaluated. Given that these electrodes cannot be reinserted, reliable techniques are necessary to achieve proper placement while minimizing subject discomfort and electrode waste. The small size, close arrangement, and anatomic variability of hand and forearm muscles create challenges to achieving these goals. In this study, we simultaneously measured maximal fingertip forces and fine-wire electromyographic signals from all seven muscles of the index finger. Forces in five directions, with and without FWEs in place, were not statistically different (repeated-measures analysis of variance, P< 0.46) in five healthy adult subjects. To guide electrode placement, we identified skin penetration landmarks, direction of needle advancement, and depth of muscle fibers. Fibers of flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger were more distal than depicted in textbooks, requiring electrode placementat or distal to the midpoint of the forearm. For these muscles and the extensor digitorum, locating the desired fibers first with a monopolar needle electrode facilitated subsequent FWF placement. For the dorsal and palmar interossei, lumbrical, and extensor indicis proprius, insertion was aided by concurrent monitoring of the electromyographic signals. We achieved a 93% success rate during FWE placement in a total of 60 muscles. Techniques for recording from each of the seven index finger muscles are described."> Fine-wire electromyographic recording during force generation.

OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis tested was that generation of torque at the wrist affects joint kinematics. DESIGN: An in vivo study of normal wrist kinematics during plantar flexion motion against a constant load was undertaken, using a custom-designed instrumented apparatus to track the motion of the hand during the task.  BACKGROUND: Despite clinical observations of a relationship between motion-loading and pain in wrists affected by rheumatoid arthritis, there is little published literature on thein vivo kinematics of the normal human wrist under load.  METHODS: Ten volunteers with no wrist pathology were tested while generating torques of zero, 1.1 and 2.2 N m in a planar, unidirectional flexion motion. Hand kinematics were computed using the Planar Rigid Body Method algorithm and an 8 degrees angular step size. The finite radius of motion and the range and standard deviation of the residuals to a fitted second-order curve were used as indices of changes in the kinematics.  RESULTS: The magnitude of both the range and standard deviation of the residuals were found to increase significantly with torque at the 95% confidence level. CONCLUSIONS: The wrist does not behave like a smooth mechanism when generating torque. Load affects carpal kinematics.  RELEVANCE: We propose that fluctuations in the finite radius of motion are the natural kinematic consequence of intercarpal motion known to occur during wrist flexion. Wrist kinematics may be particularly sensitive to load and joint integrity because orchestrated intercarpal motion depends on the soundness of articular and ligamentous structures, the first to be affected in joint degenerating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, wrist kinematics under load may be a key to characterizing joint integrity. In wrist pathologies, simple planar testing of carpal kinematics under reproducible and controlled joint torque conditions may be a useful way to assess joint involvement before the onset of gross dysfunction, and to evaluate treatment outcomes.">Load dependence in carpal kinematics during wrist flexion in vivo. </a>
