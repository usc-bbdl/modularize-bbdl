<h3>
Yves Nazon III <br /><br />
</h3>

<p>
My research interests are primarily in the fields of controls and design, particularly for biologically inspired systems. The project I worked on was designing and fabricating an implantable elastic prosthesis that would allow for grasping of various objects. Outside of research I am a huge fan of all things sports, especially basketball and lacrosse.
