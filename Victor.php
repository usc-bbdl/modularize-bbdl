<h3> Victor Barradas <br /><br /> </h3>

<p> I received my BS in Mechatronics Engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and was also admitted into the PhD program in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California in 2014. 
My research interests comprise robotic manipulation, the biomechanics of the hand, and the relations between them, using tools
from systems and control theory, and physiological modelling of the neuromuscular system. </p>
