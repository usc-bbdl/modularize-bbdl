As research in speech production becomes more integrated with linguistic theory, it has become increasingly clear that speech articulation cannot be understood
independently of complex linguistic structure. This structure occurs at different levels of granularity ranging from the internal structuring of words to the
informational or prosodic structuring of utterances. Influences of high-level
linguistic organization pervade low-level articulatory behavior. We will consider particulars of how linguistic structure conditions the temporal realization of articulatory movement during speaking. Specifically, we will use
kinematic studies of articulation to illuminate the interaction of syllable structure,
which is phonological in nature, and phrasal structure, which is prosodic in
nature. Experiments using articulatory kinematic data and concomitant
modeling of their results provide a profile of the manner in which
the temporal patterning of articulatory gestures is shaped. Understanding the
organization of articulation as a function of the linguistic structuring of utterances
is critical to developing a unified account of how abstract linguistic structure is
communicated in spoken language.
