  Injuries to the lower extremity comprise a large portion of orthopaedic practice. Recent evidence suggests that atypical movements resulting from poor proximal control is a contributing factor to many overuse and traumatic injuries of the lower limb. One of the long standing debates in the clinical community is whether the aberrant movement patterns associated with such injuries are the result of impaired muscular strength or poor neuromotor control. Over the past 15 years, our group has taken a multidisciplinary approach to better understand the root cause(s) of musculoskeletal disorders. This talk will explore the pathomechanics of various lower extremity injuries and discuss competing theories related to the causes of related movement dysfunction. Implications for rehabilitation and injury prevention will be discussed.
