 We relate recent data on neurophysiological correlates in monkey
tool use as observed in the mirror system and elsewhere to our own
modeling of the mirror system and sequential action and our fMRI
studies of shared activation between executing a grip with the hand
and with a tool. These data and modeling efforts provide material
for a critique which grounds a new, unified account of mirror
neurons, sequential actions, tools, end-effectors, and the body
schema.
