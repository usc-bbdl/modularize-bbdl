In 2001, he spent half a year atthe University of Western Australia in Perth (Australia) as a visiting researcher at the Australian International Gravitational Research Centre, School of Physics. Heiko got his PhD in robotics and machine learning in 2004: his PhD thesis was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Munich (Germany), and the PhD degree (Dr. rer. nat.) was awarded from the Faculty of Technology, Bielefeld University (the Max Planck Society did not award PhD degrees). After a post-doctoral fellowship at the Institute of Perception, Action and Behavior, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh (UK), Heiko joined the University of Southern California in January 2007. First, he worked with Dr. Stefan Schaal under a research grant from the German Research Foundation (DFG). Then, in January 2009, Heiko joined Dr Francisco Valero-Cuevas' Brain-BodyDynamics Lab.</p><p>A list of publications by Dr. Hoffmann can be found <a class="centerlink" href="http://www.heikohoffmann.de/publications.html">here</a>.</p><?php include("TemplateLower.php"); ?>
