<a class="centerlink"  href="Papers/InouyeRSS.pdf" target="_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms in general, and tendon-driven ?ngers in particular, are ubiquitous in nature, and
are an important class of bio-inspired mechatronic systems. However, the mechanical complexity of tendon-driven
systems has hindered our understanding of biological systems, and the optimization of the design, performance,
control, and construction of mechatronic systems. Here we apply our recently-developed analytical approach to
tendon-driven systems [1] to describe a novel, systematic approach to analyze and optimize the routing of tendons
for force-production capabilities of a recon?gurable 3D tendon-driven ?nger. Our results show that these capabilities
could be increased by up to 277% by rerouting tendons, and up to 82% by changing speci?c pulley sizes for speci?c
routings. In addition, we validate these large gains in performance experimentally. The experimental results for 6
implemented tendon routings correlated very highly with theoretical predictions with an R2
value of 0.987, and
the average effect of unmodeled friction decreased performance an average of 12%. We not only show that, as
expected, functional performance can be highly sensitive to tendon routing and pulley size, but also that informed
design of ?ngers with fewer tendons can exceed the performance of some ?ngers with more tendons. This now
enables the systematic simpli?cation and/or optimization of the design and construction of novel robotic/prosthetic
?ngers. Lastly, this design and analysis approach can now be used to model complex biological systems such as
the human hand to understand the synergistic nature of anatomical structure and neural control." >Optimizing the Topology of Tendon-Driven Fingers: Rationale, Predictions and Implementation. </a><br />
