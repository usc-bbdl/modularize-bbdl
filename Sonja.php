<strong> Brief Bio </strong>

<p>
I am beginning my first year as PhD student in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Southern California. As a triathlete and long time runner, I am fascinated by human motion and the body's interaction with the environment.  I hope to pursue these interests throughout my PhD.  I have my Bachelor Degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of California, Davis and my Masters in Neurotechnology from Imperial College London, under the Whitaker International Fellowship.
