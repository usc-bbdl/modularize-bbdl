<h3> Suraj Raja <br /><br /> </h3>

<p> The focus of my research is Bio-mimetic electronics. A large part of the human nervous system functions using electricity and I want to understand their underlying operating models with possible applications in prosthesis and synthetic brains on-chip using Field Programmable Gate Arrays. <br /> <br />
  
I am currently pursuing my PhD. in Electrical Engineering here at USC. I was awarded my B.TECH. in Electronics and Communication Engineering by SRM university in India.</p>
