<h3> Srideep Musuvathy <br /><br /> </h3>

<p> I am a Post-Doctoral Research Assocaite in <a class="centerlink" href="http://bme.usc.edu/">
Biomedical Engineering Deparment at USC</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Dynamical Systems Theory and Controls with applications to biological
systems. I also have Masters degrees in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Mathematics.

<p> I am currently pursing research in applications of controllability and observability theories in
rehabilitation, evaluation of theories of spinal circuitry using robotic and cadaver systems, and
investigating the first principles of how the skeletal muscles work. </p>
