<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2016_Inouye_RechingStiffness.pdf" target = "_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: Much debate has arisen from research on muscle synergies with respect to both limb impedance control and energy consumption. Studies of limb impedance control in the context of reaching movements and postural tasks have produced divergent findings, and this study explores whether the use of synergies by the central nervous system (CNS) can resolve these findings and also provide insights on mechanisms of energy consumption. In this study, we phrase these debates at the conceptual level of interactions between neural degrees of freedom and tasks constraints. This allows us to examine the ability of experimentally-observed synergiesÑcorrelated muscle activationsÑto control both energy consumption and the stiffness component of limb endpoint impedance. In our nominal 6-muscle planar arm model, muscle synergies and the desired size, shape, and orientation of endpoint stiffness ellipses, are expressed as linear constraints that define the set of feasible muscle activation patterns. Quadratic programming allows us to predict whether and how energy consumption can be minimized throughout the workspace of the limb given those linear constraints. We show that the presence of synergies drastically decreases the ability of the CNS to vary the properties of the endpoint stiffness and can even preclude the ability to minimize energy. Furthermore, the capacity to minimize energy consumptionÑwhen availableÑcan be greatly affected by arm posture. Our computational approach helps reconcile divergent findings and conclusions about task-specific regulation of endpoint stiffness and energy consumption in the context of synergies. But more generally, these results provide further evidence that the benefits and disadvantages of muscle synergies go hand-in-hand with the structure of feasible muscle activation patterns afforded by the mechanics of the limb and task constraints. These insights will help design experiments to elucidate the interplay between synergies and the mechanisms of learning, plasticity, versatility and pathology in neuromuscular systems..">

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/2015_Lawrence_Balance_Contributors.pdf" target = "_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: For young adults, balance is essential for participation in physical activities but is often disrupted following lower extremity injury. Clinical outcome measures such as single limb balance (SLB), Y-balance (YBT), and the single limb hop and balance (SLHB) tests are commonly used to quantify balance ability following injury. Given the varying demands across tasks, it is likely that such outcome measures provide useful, although task-specific, information. But the extent to which they are independent and contribute to understanding the multiple contributors to balance is not clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the associations among these measures as they relate to the different contributors to balance. Thirty- seven recreationally active young adults completed measures including vertical jump, YBT, SLB, SLHB, and the new Lower Extremity Dexterity test. Principal components analysis revealed that these outcome measures could be thought of as quantifying the strength, multi-joint coordination, and sensorimotor processing contributors to balance. Our results challenge the practice of using a single outcome measure to quantify the naturally multidimensional mechanisms for everyday functions such as balance. This multidimensional approach to, and interpretation of, multiple contributors to balance may lead to more effective, specialized training and rehabilitation regimens.">

<a class="centerlink" href="Papers/Ko_PDDexterity.pdf" target = "_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: ParkinsonÕs disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1Ð2% of the population over the age of 65. Individuals with PD experience gradual deterioration of dexterous manipulation for activities of daily living; however, current clinical evaluations are mostly subjective and do not quantify changes in dynamic control of fingertip force that is critical for manual dexterity. Thus, there is a need to develop clinical measures to quantify those changes with aging and disease progression. We investigated the dynamic control of fingertip forces in both hands of 20 individuals with PD (69.0 ± 7.4 years) using the StrengthÐDexterity test. The test requires low forces (<3 N) to compress a compliant and slender spring prone to buckling. A maximal level of sustained compression is informative of the greatest instability the person can control, and thus is indicative of the integrity of the neuromuscular system for dexterous manipulation. Miniature sensors recorded fingertip force (F) during maximal sustained compressions. The force variability during sustained compression was quantified in two frequency bands: low (<4 Hz, F_LF) and high (4Ð12 Hz, F_HF). F_LF characterizes variability in voluntary fluctuations, while F_HF characterizes variability in involuntary fluctuations including tremor. The more-affected hand exhibited significantly lower F and lower F_LF than those in the less-affected hand. The more-affected hand showed significant negative correlations between F_LF and the Unified ParkinsonÕs Disease Rating Scale motor scores for both total and hand-only, suggesting that greater force variability in the voluntary range was associated with less clinical motor impairment. We conclude the nature of force variability in the voluntary range during this dynamic and dexterous task may be a biomarker of greater motor capability/flexibility/adaptability in PD. This approach may provide a more quantitative clinical assessment of changes of sensorimotor control in individuals with PD.">

<a class="centerlink"   href="Papers/2015_Lawrence_HandOutcomeMeasures.pdf" target = "_blank" TITLE = "Abstract: Understanding the mapping between individual outcome measures and the latent functional domains of interest is critical to a quantitative evaluation and rehabilitation of hand function. We examined whether and how the associations among six hand-specific outcome measures reveal latent functional domains in elderly individuals. We asked 66 healthy older adult participants (38F, 28M, 66.1 ± 11.6 years, range: 45Ð88 years) and 33 older adults (65.8 ± 9.7 years, 44Ð81 years, 51 hands) diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) of the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint, to complete six functional assessments: hand strength (Grip, Key and Precision Pinch), Box and Block, Nine Hole Pegboard, and Strength-Dexterity tests. The first three principal components suffice to explain 86% of variance among the six outcome measures in healthy older adults, and 84% of variance in older adults with CMC OA. The composition of these dominant associations revealed three distinct latent functional domains: strength, coordinated upper extremity function, and sensorimotor processing. Furthermore, in participants with thumb CMC OA we found a blurring of the associations between the latent functional domains of strength and coordinated upper extremity function. This motivates future work to understand how the physiological effects of thumb CMC OA lead upper extremity coordination to become strongly associated with strength, while dynamic sensorimotor ability remains an independent functional domain. Thus, when assessing the level of hand function in our growing older adult populations, it is particularly important to acknowledge its multidimensional natureÑand explicitly consider how each outcome measure maps to these three latent and fundamental domains of function. Moreover, this ability to distinguish among latent functional domains may facilitate the design of treatment modalities to target the rehabilitation of each of them." >
