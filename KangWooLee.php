<strong> Research Description </strong>


<p>
I received my B.S. in Electronics and Computer Engineering from South Korea in 2012. I worked at Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, which is the research institute of Seoul National University, before I came to U.S. to start the M.S. program in 2013 Fall semester. During the first semester, I participated in two projects in Center for Neural Engineering. My research advisor was Dr. Dong Song and I worked on nonlinear modeling of hippocampal prostheses with him. In the following semester, I worked on vowel generation for children with cerebral palsy using myocontrol of a speech synthesizer with Dr. Terence D. Sanger. During summer vacation, I started one more project for optimal human aortic pressure patterns for hydraulic power minimization with Dr. Stanley M. Yamashiro to have knowledge from various research fields.

Currently, I am working on Neuromorphic biomechanic system for emulating human hand movement at Brain Body Dynamics Laboratory.
