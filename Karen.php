<h3>
Karen Poblete <br /><br />
</h3>

<p>
I have two bachelor degrees, in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, from Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM). I am studying the last year of my Masters in Computer Science at the same institution. Now, I am  a summer intern at the Brain-Body Dynamic Lab at USC, helping with the R01 project. The R01 project involves experiments related to the mobility of a mechanic arm which works analogous to an arm with real muscle.
</br>
</br>
My areas of interest are data mining, artificial intelligence, and robotics applied to biomedicine. During my undergraduate time I was part of the Robotic Lab at ITAM. I was in charge of the intelligence and playing strategies for a robot soccer team related to the RocoCup tournament. My more recent works as a Masters student include my contribution to KES conference 2015, which is going to be held in Singapore during September 2015. I wrote a paper in collaboration with Dr. Cair√≥ who works at the Computer Science department of ITAM in Mexico. The paper is about a visual language, designed to help in the knowledge acquisition process for knowledge based systems. </p>
